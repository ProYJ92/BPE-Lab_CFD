Use the Mesh Quality tool to check the quality and improve or regenerate the mesh if necessary. Use the &#39;Improve Mesh&#39; function in the preprocessing step or local refinement. The mesh quality is especially important in the boundary layer or in areas where the flow changes rapidly. Check boundary conditions: Recheck that all boundary conditions are physically reasonable and fit the problem definition. Check that the inlet and outlet conditions, wall conditions, etc. are set correctly and that the value ranges are appropriate. Check the physics model suitability: Check that you have selected the appropriate model for the physics you are trying to analyze (turbulence model, multiphase model, combustion model, etc.). For example, using a simple turbulence model for very complex turbulent flows can lead to poor convergence or inaccurate results. Adjust the solver settings: Under-Relaxation Factors: Reducing the URF for each variable (e.g., from the default values of 0.3 and 0.7 for pressure and momentum) can improve numerical stability, but slow down convergence. A common approach is to reduce the URF in case of divergence. Time Step Size: If the time step is too large during a transient analysis, it can cause divergence. Set an appropriate time step considering the Courant Number, or utilize the Adaptive Time Stepping feature. Even in steady-state analysis, setting the virtual time step can be important when using the Pseudo Transient technique. Discretization Schemes: You can start the calculation with a first-order accuracy scheme (such as First Order Upwind) to obtain a stable initial solution, and then gradually change to a higher-order accuracy scheme (such as Second Order Upwind, QUICK) to increase the accuracy. Pressure-Velocity Coupling Algorithm: Select the SIMPLE, SIMPLEC, PISO, or Coupled algorithm that best suits the problem characteristics. Coupled algorithms are generally more robust, but can use more memory. Initial Conditions: Inappropriate initial conditions can cause divergence. Set initial values that are as close to the actual physics as possible, or gradually change the conditions and proceed with the analysis (e.g., start with a low inlet velocity and gradually increase to the target velocity).",

Bioprocess CFD Applications / Case StudiesBioprocess CFD has been widely applied across various stages and systems in bioprocesses to contribute to process understanding, design optimization, and performance improvement. Key Application Areas and Case StudiesBioreactor Design and Optimization: Predict internal flow patterns, mixing times, shear stress distributions, oxygen transfer coefficients (kLa), etc. of various reactor types such as stirred tank reactors (STRs), plug flow reactors (PFRs), airlift reactors, fluidized bed reactors, and wave reactors2-3. This can be used to determine the optimal impeller shape, arrangement, aeration method, etc.1-3. Case: There is a case where CFD modeling of a 4.1 m³ industrial-scale stirred reactor was used to compare and verify the power consumption, liquid height, mixing time, etc. with experimental data, and the stirring speed was optimized through kLa distribution analysis1. Scale-up and scale-down: It is used to predict the mixing and transfer non-uniformity that occurs in large-scale reactors, and based on this, it is used to rationally design a scale-down system that simulates actual process conditions at the laboratory scale1-2. Case: CFD was utilized in a design study of a plug-flow scale-down device connecting a 20 L laboratory-scale STR and a 4000 L industrial-scale STR2. Compute the mixing time difference between scales using CFD, and analyze the flow behavior and residence time distribution within the PFR in detail to evaluate the effects of static mixers, etc.2. Mixing and mass transfer analysis: Analyze the mixing efficiency, dead zone formation, and micro-mixing characteristics of complex fluids such as high viscosity fluids, non-Newtonian fluids (e.g., anaerobic digester substrates), and solid suspensions1-2. Predict the mass transfer rate and distribution between liquid-gas and liquid-solid to evaluate oxygen transfer efficiency, etc.1. Cell culture and fermentation processes: Quantitatively assess the environmental heterogeneity experienced by cells in large-scale fermenters and cell culture reactors, such as local substrate, dissolved oxygen, pH, and shear stress1-2. Combine with cell reaction kinetic models to predict and optimize the effects of specific environmental conditions on cell growth rate, viability, metabolic pathways, and product quality (e.g., protein glycosylation patterns)1-2. Case study: The effects of oxygen limitation and substrate heterogeneity on Fab protein production in high cell density E. coli cultures were analyzed using a CFD-based scale-down model2. It is also used in research on various cell lines such as CHO cells, Hybridoma cells, etc.2. Separation and purification processes: Simulate the flow and mass transfer inside separation devices such as chromatography columns and filters to improve efficiency and support scale-up. Biofilm and immobilized cell systems: Evaluate the flow and mass transfer restrictions inside and around immobilized biofilms or particles and predict reactor performance. Bioprocess CFD is increasing its reliability by comparing and verifying theoretical modeling results with actual process data, but challenges still exist due to the difficulty in measuring real-time spatiotemporal variations in large-scale reactors2. Nonetheless, CFD has established itself as an indispensable tool for bioprocess development and productivity improvement.

IntroductionIn bioprocess engineering, the design and operation of bioreactors have a significant impact on production efficiency, product quality, and economic feasibility. In particular, industrial-scale large-scale bioreactors experience increasingly severe mixing gradient problems as they scale up, resulting in local concentration deviations in substrates, dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH1-2, which negatively affect the physiological activity and metabolic pathways of cells, leading to decreased productivity1-3. Traditional experimental approaches or simple models have limitations in sufficiently capturing these complex spatiotemporal heterogeneities1-2. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has emerged as a powerful tool for detailed simulations of fluid flow, mixing, heat and mass transfer, and shear stress distribution in bioreactors1-5. CFD provides essential information for physically predicting the fluid dynamic behavior of complex systems, improving reactor design, finding optimal operating conditions, and establishing effective scale-up/scale-down strategies1-3. Recently, active research has been conducted to integrate the Cellular Reaction Kinetics (CRK) model into fluid dynamics modeling to more accurately predict and analyze the dynamic conditions that cells experience in actual reactor environments1-2. This integrated CFD-CRK approach is attracting attention as a key technology for intelligent bio-manufacturing and building digital twins in the era of &quot;Industry 4.0&quot;1-4. However, the significantly different time scales of fluid dynamics (seconds) and biological treatment processes (days) and the high computational cost are major challenges for integrated modeling1-2.

Main CFD Software ComparisonThe main software used in the bioprocess CFD field varies in terms of ease of use, functions, performance, cost, and support environment. It can be broadly divided into commercial software and open source software. Major Bioprocess CFD Software Classification Software Major Features and Strengths Related to Bioprocess Considerations Commercial ANSYS Fluent - No. 1 in market share, proven reliability in a wide range of industrial fields - Powerful turbulent, multiphase flow (VOF, Euler-Euler, Euler-Lagrange), and reactive flow modeling capabilities - User-friendly GUI, abundant technical support, and educational materials provided - Many research and industrial applications in the bioprocess field1-2-6 High license cost, restrictions on customization when implementing complex models COMSOL Multiphysics - Strength in coupled modeling of multiphysics phenomena (flow, heat transfer, chemical reaction, electrochemistry, structure, etc.) - Advantageous for integrating complex biological reactions and cell models - Convenient GUI-based model setup Some specialized fluid dynamics functions may be limited compared to ANSYS Fluent, high license cost2-6 Simcenter STAR-CCM+ - Integrated CFD solution from Siemens PLM Software - Suitable for large-scale industrial modeling, powerful preprocessing and postprocessing functions - Provides various physical models and customizing options ANSYS Similar features and considerations to Fluent, high licensing costsANSYS CFX- Another general-purpose CFD solution from ANSYS- Strong in analyzing flows in rotating machinery (pumps, turbines, etc.)- Similar functionality to Fluent (with some different modeling approaches)2-6Similar features and considerations to Fluent, with more use cases for Fluent in the bioprocess fieldM-Star CFD- Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM)-based software specialized in modeling particles (cells, microorganisms) and multiphase flows- Strong in analyzing complex geometries and dynamic systemsMay be limited in application areas and user base compared to general-purpose FVM softwarePHOENICS- One of the earliest commercial CFD software, offers a variety of physical models- Has specialized applications in specific areasLatest interface and feature updates may be slower than major competitors2FLOW-3D- Strong in modeling free surfaces and complex interactions (VOF model)- Specialized in specific areas such as microfluidics, castings3Bioprocess versatility and support for a variety of multiphase/bioreaction models may be limitedOpen sourceOpenFOAM- Free, fully open-source framework- source Highly customizable, including code modifications and implementation of new physics models, numerical techniques - Active developer and user community, performance optimized for HPC environments4-5-6No GUI (or requires separate installation), high learning curve, lack of technical support (depends on community)Nek5000 - High-accuracy turbulence analysis based on spectral element method - Faster computational speed than OpenFOAM for certain problems6Limited modeling options and multiphase/reaction flexibility, not suitable for complex bioprocess applications6Mfix - Open source, specialized for multiphase particle-gas flows - Built-in chemical reactivity and multiphase models6Inefficient for single-phase flow simulation, better suited for certain types of bioprocesses (e.g. solid-gas reactors)6Performance and selection considerationsPerformance: The performance of a CFD simulation is highly dependent on the numerical technique used, the physics model, mesh quality, and hardware (CPU, GPU, cache, etc.) performance and architecture4. A recent study showed that AMD EPYC processors outperformed Intel and Arm in certain HPC environments on OpenFOAM-based microbenchmarks5. However, for real complex Bioprocess problems, optimization of the software itself and parallel processing efficiency are also important. Accuracy: The accuracy of the selected physical model (turbulence, multiphase, etc.) and numerical solution, mesh resolution and verification, and validation against experimental data determine the reliability of the model results1-2. Ease of use and support: Commercial software is easy to use and troubleshoot with an intuitive GUI, abundant tutorials, and professional technical support. Open source is free to customize, but you often have to solve all problems yourself. Cost: Open source has no license fee, but there are engineering manpower and learning costs required for model development, setup, execution, and troubleshooting. Commercial software has high initial and maintenance costs, but it can be advantageous in terms of total cost of ownership due to efficient workflows and reliable technical support6. The selection of Bioprocess CFD software should be comprehensively considered, including the complexity of the specific application (multiphase, reaction type, fluid properties, etc.), required accuracy, computational resources, budget, user experience, and technical support needs. In the industry, commercial software (especially ANSYS Fluent, STAR-CCM+, COMSOL) that provide proven functions and stable support are widely used, while in the academic and research fields, open source (OpenFOAM) that provides high freedom and cost efficiency is also increasingly utilized.

Theoretical BackgroundBioprocess CFD models fluid flow and related transport phenomena in a reactor by numerically solving the mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations of the fluid1. The core is to solve the Navier-Stokes equations, which are nonlinear partial differential equations1. In real bioprocesses, various physicochemical and biological phenomena such as turbulence, multiphase flow, chemical reactions, and biological activities occur in a complex manner, so additional theoretical and numerical techniques are required to effectively model these phenomena.Major Modeling Techniques and Equations1. Basic Equations: Mass Conservation Equation (Continuity Equation) Momentum Conservation Equation (Navier-Stokes Equation): Describes the fluid momentum under the forces due to the viscosity and pressure of the fluid and the external forces (e.g. gravity, stirring force). Energy Conservation Equation: Describes heat transfer and temperature change. Component Transport Equation: Describes the concentration change of specific chemical species (substrates, products, dissolved gases, etc.) including diffusion and convection effects.2. Turbulence Model: Since the flow inside the bioreactor is mostly turbulent, the irregular and complex characteristics of turbulence must be modeled. 1. Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations: The instantaneous flow variables are divided into time-averaged and fluctuating components to model the mean flow. The turbulent stress term is calculated through an additional model (turbulence model). 1. k-ε model: This is the most widely used model, and it solves the transport equations for the turbulent kinetic energy (k) and the dissipation rate (ε). Improved versions such as the realizable k-ε model are used. 1. k-ω model: It has strengths in analyzing the flow near the wall. The k-ω SST (Shear Stress Transport) model combines the strengths of the k-ε model (free flow) and the k-ω model (near the wall) and is suitable for complex flows. 1-2. Large Eddy Simulation (LES): This method directly calculates large-scale turbulent eddies and models small-scale eddies. More accurate than RANS but much more computationally expensive2. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS): Directly calculates turbulence at all scales, but is only applicable to academic research or small systems due to its very high computational cost.3. Multiphase flow model: Bioprocesses are often multiphase systems that include, in addition to the liquid phase, bubbles (aeration), cells/particles (dispersed phase), etc.2. Euler-Euler approach: Treats each phase as an interpenetrating continuum, and solves the conservation equations of momentum and mass for each phase together2. Computationally inexpensive, but has limitations in modeling the detailed behavior of individual particles/bubbles. Euler-Lagrange approach: The flow field, which is a continuum, is calculated using the Eulerian method, and dispersed phase particles (cells, bubbles) track their individual trajectories using the Lagrangian method and solve the equations of motion2. Detailed tracking of each particle is possible, but computationally expensive. Volume of Fluid (VOF) model: Used to track the interface of two or more immiscible fluids (e.g., liquid-gas)1. Suitable for modeling the dynamic behavior of free surfaces or bubbles on the top of a bioreactor. 4. Cell Reaction Dynamics (CRK) Model Integration: By combining a fluid dynamics model and a biological reaction model (usually ordinary differential equations), the effects of local environmental changes experienced by cells on biological reactions can be analyzed1-2. Directly coupled: Solve the CFD equations and the CRK equations simultaneously. Most accurate, but computationally very expensive1-2. Uncoupled: After obtaining the flow field by CFD calculation, this result is used as the input of the CRK model. Computationally inexpensive, but has limitations in reflecting dynamic interactions1. Indirect Coupling/Compartmental Model: Divide the reactor into several compartments based on the CFD results, and apply the CRK model using the average flow characteristics within each compartment1-2. It provides a balance between computational cost and accuracy, and can be suitable for real-time simulations. 5. Rotating Component Modeling: Used to simulate the influence of rotating components such as impellers. Multiple Reference Frame (MRF) Model: Separates the rotating and fixed regions to improve computational efficiency1. Mainly used for steady-state simulations. Sliding Mesh Model: Directly models the relative movement of the meshes of the rotating and fixed regions, allowing for accurate simulation of unsteady-state flow. Computational cost is higher than MRF1. Bioprocess CFD combines these various theoretical models and numerical techniques to simulate real bioreactor environments, especially to accurately predict complex multiphase reacting flows and biological interactions.

There are various models such as k-epsilon, k-omega, and Spalart-Allmaras. It is suitable for steady-state flow, but the unsteady RANS (Unsteady RANS, URANS) method is also actively used to analyze time-dependent mean flow.

Turbulence modeling for handling turbulent flow is also a key part, and recently, in addition to the traditional Navier-Stokes equation-based model, various approaches such as the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) have been utilized. A detailed comparison and explanation of the various numerical analysis techniques, turbulence models, and multiphase flow models used in the solving phase can be found on the CFD Solving page. Governing Equations Fluid flow is governed by continuum mechanics and follows the following conservation laws: Continuity Equation - Conservation of Mass The principle states that the rate of change of mass within a given volume element is equal to the net flow of mass across the boundary of that volume. ∂ρ/∂t + ∇ ⋅ (ρu) = 0 (ρ: density, u: velocity vector, t: time, ∇: Nabla operator) For incompressible flow (ρ = const.), this simplifies to ∇ ⋅ u = 0. Momentum Equation - Navier-Stokes Equation This is an application of Newton&#39;s second law (F=ma) to fluid elements, and describes the forces (pressure gradient force, viscous force, body force, etc.) acting on a fluid element and the resulting momentum. It represents the balance of change rates. ρ Du/Dt = -∇p + μ∇²u + f(p: pressure, μ: coefficient of kinematic viscosity, ∇²: Laplacian operator, f: body force vector) Here, Du/Dt = ∂u/∂t + (u ⋅ ∇)u is the material derivative, which includes the time rate of change and the convection term. The Navier-Stokes equations are nonlinear, and analytical solutions exist only in very limited cases. The existence and uniqueness of a smooth solution to the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations is a difficult problem that has not yet been mathematically proven. Energy Equation - Conservation of Energy It is the principle that the rate of change of the total energy (internal energy, kinetic energy) of a fluid element is equal to the sum of the heat transfer rate and the work (pressure work, viscous work, etc.) applied to the element. It describes temperature change, heat transfer, energy change due to compression/expansion, etc. These equations form a system of simultaneous partial differential equations including three unknown variables such as velocity, pressure, density, and temperature in the case of compressible flow. In order to solve this, additional equations of state (e.g., ideal gas law p = ρRT) are required. Turbulence Modeling Most real engineering flows have complex and irregular turbulent characteristics. Since direct turbulence calculation (DNS) requires enormous computational resources, turbulent effects are modeled in real CFD. DNS (Direct Numerical Simulation): Directly calculates all scales of turbulence. It is the most accurate, but it is only applicable to simple flows with very low Reynolds numbers, and is computationally expensive, so it is mainly used in academic research. RANS (Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes): It separates instantaneous flow variables into time-averaged and fluctuating components and solves the averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The effects due to turbulent fluctuations (Reynolds stresses) are approximated using a turbulence model. It is the most widely used industrially because it has the lowest computational cost. There are various models such as k-epsilon, k-omega, and Spalart-Allmaras. It is suitable for steady-state flow, but the unsteady RANS (Unsteady RANS, URANS) method is also actively used to analyze the time-dependent mean flow. URANS can capture large-scale turbulent structures or periodic phenomena that change over time by maintaining the time term of the RANS equation, which provides more information than the existing steady RANS model (for details, see the URANS model page). [MD6, MD7] LES (Large Eddy Simulation): Large turbulent eddies are directly calculated, and only the influence of eddies smaller than the grid size is modeled using a sub-grid scale model. It is more accurate than RANS and predicts the behavior of unsteady flow better, but it is much more computationally expensive than RANS. High grid resolution is required near the wall. Hybrid RANS-LES models (e.g. DES - Detached Eddy Simulation): RANS model is used near the wall boundary layer, and LES model is used far from the wall to trade off computational efficiency and accuracy. Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is a mesoscopic methodology for simulating fluid flow. Instead of directly discretizing the traditional macroscopic Navier-Stokes equations, it tracks how a distribution function of virtual particles defined on a grid collides and moves over time. [MD1] This approach is based on the kinetic principle that microscopic interactions of fluids are manifested as macroscopic flow phenomena, and is particularly strong in handling boundary conditions of complex geometries, multiphase flows, microfluidics problems, and massively parallel computational environments. [MD1, MD2] More detailed theory, mathematical background, advantages and disadvantages, and applications of LBM can be found on the LBM model details page. Unsteady RANS (Unsteady RANS, URANS) modelThe unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) model is an extension of the traditional RANS approach to describe time-varying flow phenomena. While RANS models predict only the steady-state mean flow by decomposing the flow variables into time-averaged and oscillating components, URANS retains the unsteady terms (time-differentiated terms) of the Navier-Stokes equations.[MD6] This allows capturing large-scale turbulent structures that evolve over time (e.g., eddy shedding, periodic flow separation) or the average behavior of transient phenomena. URANS is used for various engineering problems because it provides richer temporal information than the normal RANS model while still being computationally less expensive than LES or DNS. [MD7] The detailed theory of the URANS model, differences from the conventional RANS, advantages and disadvantages, and major application cases are covered in detail on the URANS model detail page.

Animations are very useful for intuitively understanding complex time-dependent flow phenomena and visually tracking the development and behavior of key flow structures. Goals of animation creation Visualize the temporal evolution of the flow field (e.g., vortex generation and decay, shock wave transport) Observe the temporal evolution of physical quantities (pressure, temperature, concentration, etc.) Determine the dynamic response of flow behavior to changes in boundary conditions or process changes Identify the characteristics of periodic flow phenomena (e.g., vortex shedding, pulsating flow) Effectively convey the temporal evolution of complex three-dimensional flow structures Process of animation creation Typically, animations are created through the following process: Loading data by time step: Load the result data files (e.g., sequence of .cas/.dat files from Ansys Fluent, .cdat files from Ansys CFD-Post, time series data formats readable by ParaView) for each time step saved during the unsteady simulation into the postprocessing tool [6]. Setting up visualization objects: Select the desired visualization objects (e.g., contours, vectors, streamlines, isosurfaces, particles) at the first or specific time step. Set the trajectory (trajectory) for the animation. Also define the color map, range, camera view, etc. Set the animation: Specify the timestep range: Set the start and end time steps for which you want to create the animation, and the interval between frames. Keyframe Animation: You can create more dynamic animations by setting keyframes that change the camera position, object properties (transparency, color, etc.) at specific time steps. Save Options: Specify the frame rate (FPS), resolution, video file format (AVI, MP4, etc.) or image sequence (PNG, JPG, etc.) format. Create and Save Animation: Depending on what you set, the post-processing tool renders images for each time step, stitches them together, and saves them as a video file or image sequence [6].

EnSight / FieldView: Professional commercial post-processing tools that support the creation of high-quality animations. These tools can provide the ability to animate not only changes over time but also changes in the flow field as a function of specific parameters (e.g., inlet velocity, rotation angle). Considerations Data size and storage interval: Unsteady simulations can generate very large amounts of data, so you need to manage disk space and processing time by setting the variables required for animation creation and the storage interval for time steps appropriately. Frame rate and resolution: These affect the smoothness and clarity of the animation, so adjust them accordingly.

They focus on clarity of visualization, accuracy of analysis, and confidence in results. General Postprocessing Tips Clarify your goals: Before you begin postprocessing, clearly define what you want to see and what information you want to obtain. This will help reduce unnecessary work and maintain focus of your analysis. Use ‘State’ files or session files: Save frequently used visualization settings (contours, streamlines, slices, filters, camera views, etc.) and analysis settings as state files (e.g. .cst for Ansys CFD-Post, .pvsm for ParaView) to automate and maintain consistency in your postprocessing pipeline [6]. This is especially useful for comparing multiple cases or during design exploration. Group surfaces and extract regions: In complex models with multiple geometries, grouping similar geometric elements (e.g. all the walls of a particular part) will help manage display settings (color, transparency, etc.) more efficiently. Also, extracting and visualizing only the specific region of interest (ROI) that you want to focus on for analysis or processing data can reduce the burden of data processing and provide a clear view of the phenomenon of interest. Use streamlines judiciously: Streamlines are very useful for identifying flow patterns, but excessive or inappropriate seed point settings can be misleading or confuse the picture. Choose the location and number of seed points carefully, and adjust the color and thickness of streamlines to improve readability. Save and load only the data you need: Manage the amount of data by minimizing the variables that the solver saves in the output file when setting up a simulation, or selectively loading only the variables and time steps needed for analysis during post-processing. This saves disk space and improves post-processing speed. Maintain consistent camera, view, and lighting settings: When comparing multiple simulation results or viewing results from different time steps of the same model, it is important to apply the same camera view and lighting settings consistently to ensure an objective comparison. Lighting is important for enhancing the depth of the 3D geometry and improving the readability of the visualization. Start simple and add incremental detail: Using too many colors or complex visual effects from the beginning can distract from conveying important messages. After identifying the basic flow structure using grayscale or transparency, it is recommended to gradually add color or other visual details. Use an appropriate color map: Select a color map that matches the characteristics of the physical quantity to be analyzed and the information you want to convey. For example, a rainbow map is commonly used for temperature distribution, but other color maps may be more appropriate for emphasizing specific values or expressing divergent data (positive/negative values). Adjust the range (min/max) of the color map appropriately so that even subtle changes are visible. Ensuring reliability and validation of post-processing results The reliability of post-processing results is directly related to the reliability of the entire CFD analysis. Therefore, it is important to apply the principles of verification and validation (V&amp;V) to the post-processing stage as well. Cross-Validation: Compare with experimental data: Compare the CFD post-processing results with reliable experimental results such as PIV, wind tunnel experiments, and field measurement data, both quantitatively and qualitatively [3, 5]. Compare key physical quantities such as flow patterns, pressure/temperature distributions, values at specific points, forces, and torques to analyze errors and evaluate the validity of the simulation model. Comparison with standard solutions/reference cases: Compare the post-processing results of the current simulation with the post-processing results of the verified problems (reference cases or benchmark problems) presented in academic papers or standard textbooks to indirectly check the accuracy of the code and model settings [8]. Comparison with other software results: If possible, compare the results obtained by other CFD solvers or post-processing tools for the same problem to check for differences due to analysis methods or tools and check consistency [8]. Quantitative error analysis: The difference from the experimental or reference values should be presented as quantitative indicators such as percentage error or RMS error, and the causes of these errors (mesh resolution, limitations of the physical model, uncertainty in boundary conditions, etc.) should be analyzed and recorded [5]. Compliance with standardized procedures: Recommendations from standards (e.g., ASME, ISO) or accredited organizations (e.g., FDA&#39;s Medical Device Blood Flow Simulation Guidelines [10]) that exist for specific industries (e.g., aerospace, automotive, medical devices) or applications. It is recommended that you perform postprocessing and report the results in compliance with the requirements. This will contribute to the objectivity and reliability of the results. Check grid dependence and convergence: Before interpreting the postprocessing results, it is essential to check whether the results were obtained on a sufficiently fine grid (grid dependence test) and whether the numerical solution is sufficiently converged (check residuals and monitored variables). It is dangerous to blindly trust the postprocessing results without these basic verifications. By following these best practices, you can greatly improve the efficiency of the CFD postprocessing process and the reliability of the results.

Postprocessing software must be able to read results data from a variety of solvers and file formats [6]. Data Formats and OutputThere are a variety of standard and proprietary formats used to store CFD results data. Standard Formats: CGNS (CFD General Notation System): A highly portable standard format for storing CFD data [6]. It is designed to contain all relevant information, including meshes, flow solutions, and boundary conditions. VTK (Visualization Toolkit): An open-source library and data format for visualization and data processing [3, 8]. Many post-processing tools such as ParaView are based on VTK [2]. HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format 5): A widely used file format for storing and managing large amounts of scientific data, and supported by some CFD tools. Proprietary formats by solvers: Ansys Fluent: .cas/.dat, .flprj, .res, .cdat, etc. [6] Ansys CFX: .res, .def, etc. [6] OpenFOAM: Own directory and file structure Others: There are various software-specific formats such as Tecplot (.plt), EnSight (.case, .geo), FieldView, etc. [2]. Simulation results are output in various forms such as numerical tables (parameter values), graphs (time or space changes), and images (2D/3D visualization) depending on the analysis purpose [5]. Processing tools and automation (Automation &amp; Workflow) Data processing is sometimes performed in the GUI environment of post-processing software, but scripting and automation tools are essential for repetitive tasks or large-scale data processing [2, 3]. Scripting:Python: Many post-processing software (e.g., ParaView [2], Tecplot, Ansys CFD-Post [6]) support a Python scripting interface. This allows you to automate tasks such as loading data, applying filters, creating visualization objects, saving images, and extracting data.CCL (CFX Command Language): A scripting language used in Ansys CFX and CFD-Post that allows you to record and replay GUI operations through session files (.cst) or automate post-processing tasks by writing your own commands [6].Journaling: Ability to record your GUI operations and save them as scripts or macros, and re-execute them to repeatedly perform the same tasks [6].Batch Mode Execution: Execute post-processing tasks in the background using scripts or journal files without a user interface (GUI) [6]. Useful when handling large numbers of cases or working in a server environment. Automated Report Generation: This is a feature that automatically generates reports that include set visualization results (images, animations) and quantitative analysis results (tables, graphs) [6]. For more information, see the Report Generation page. Building a Post-Processing Pipeline: In industries, post-processing pipelines that automate a series of processes from data loading to analysis, visualization, and report generation are built to increase reliability and flexibly respond to changes in development requirements [2, 3]. Handling Large-volume/Anomalous Data Large-scale grids or long-term, unsteady (time-dependent) CFD simulation results are very large, requiring effective processing techniques. Frequency filtering, metadata extraction, data compression, event-based GUI programming, and building automated pipelines are important for handling large-scale, unsteady data [8]. Advanced techniques such as in-situ processing (data processing and analysis during simulation execution) are also being studied.

It complements visual analysis and is essential for validation against experimental results, confirmation that design requirements are met, and more in-depth engineering analysis. Extraction Targets and MethodsPost-processing software provides the ability to extract data from a variety of geometric objects [6]:Point Extraction: Directly probe the values of physical quantities (such as pressure, velocity, temperature) at specific XYZ coordinates within the computational domain. The Probe function can be used to extract time-varying data at specific coordinates or nodes and create a time series plot. This is useful for analyzing transient interpretation results [2, 6]. Line/Polyline Extraction: Extracts physical quantity distribution data along a user-defined straight line, curve, or polyline. The extracted data is mainly visualized in the form of an XY plot, and is used to identify the variation pattern of physical quantities along a specific path. (e.g. pressure drop along the centerline of a pipe, pressure distribution along a blade surface)Plane/Surface/Slice Extraction: Extracts physical quantity distributions from a cross-section (Slice) that cuts the computational domain by a specific plane or surface. You can extract data from the entire cross-section or a specific region, or calculate the Area Integral or Area-Weighted Average values (e.g. average velocity, flow rate at a specific cross-section). Data can also be extracted from surfaces generated based on specific physical quantity values, such as isosurfaces.Volume Extraction: Extracts data from a specific volume region within the computational domain. The Volume Integral or Volume-Weighted Average can be used to determine the overall physical quantity characteristics of the region (e.g. average temperature in a specific space, total kinetic energy).Utilization of Extracted DataGenerate XY Plot: Plot data over time at a line or specific point as an XY graph. Quantitatively analyze the trend of changes in physical quantities. Create data tables: Export the extracted data in tabular format for further processing or analysis in other analysis tools (e.g., Excel, MATLAB, Python Pandas). Compare with experimental data: Validate the accuracy of the model by directly comparing the data measured at specific points or paths in the experiment with the data extracted from the CFD simulation [3, 5]. Calculate design metrics: Evaluate the design performance by calculating derived data (e.g., forces, moments, efficiencies) based on the extracted data. Write reports and presentations: Quantitatively extracted data and their visualization graphs serve as important supporting data for the CFD analysis results. It is important to extract data from the correct location and correctly interpret the physical meaning of the extracted values. It is also important to be aware of the possibility of interpolation errors due to the grid resolution when extracting data.

Since CFD analysis targets the space where the fluid flows, the area occupied by the fluid (Fluid Domain or Internal Volume) must be separated and extracted from this solid geometry6-8. For External Flow analysis, a virtual external region (bounding box or external domain) surrounding the analysis target object is created and the fluid domain is defined by excluding the object solid volume from this region. Computational domain definition and size: The computational domain defines the spatial extent in which the fluid flow will be simulated, and its size is very important as it directly affects the accuracy of the analysis results23, 24. The boundary surface should be set wide enough to avoid artificial influence on the physics22, 23. **International guidelines and academic research recommendations**22-24: Single building external flow: Generally, the distance from the flow inlet to the building is recommended to be at least **5H** of the representative height (H) of the building, **15H** to the rear exit of the building, and **5H** to the side and top boundaries. Group of buildings external flow: The above criteria are applied based on the tallest building (Hmax) in the domain, and the Blockage Ratio (the ratio of the building front projection area to the domain cross-sectional area) should be within **3%** to minimize artificial air acceleration and distortion. can be. When setting the calculation domain, it is necessary to consider the calculation efficiency by adjusting the level of detail according to the distance, including the surrounding buildings, structures, and terrain that can affect the main flow24. Method: Most preprocessing software provides the function to automatically extract the internal or external fluid region based on the solid shape6-8. This is often done by utilizing Boolean operations or techniques of extracting surfaces and then solidifying them. Note: The extracted fluid volume becomes the actual calculation domain for mesh generation. If the consistency issue of the CAD model is not resolved during this process, the fluid volume extraction may fail or an incomplete (with holes) volume may be generated. It is important to accurately extract only the fluid region that is required for the analysis purpose.",

The neighboring information of each cell is managed as an index, so the memory usage is small15, and when the grid lines are aligned to the flow direction or boundary, the numerical diffusion is small, so the accuracy is high. Advantages: It is simple to implement and has high computational efficiency14, and the memory usage is small15. Easy to control mesh quality. Disadvantages: Difficult or impossible to generate for complex or irregular geometries14, 15, 24. Unstructured Mesh: Characteristics: There is no regular connection structure, and 2D is mainly composed of triangle cells and 3D is mainly composed of tetrahedral cells14, 15, 24. Polyhedral, pyramid, and prism cells are also used15, 24. Adjacent cell information must be explicitly stored15. For large-scale complex geometries such as city-scale, tetrahedral meshes are recommended because they are flexible and easy to generate24. Advantages: It is easy to automatically generate meshes for complex and arbitrary geometries14, 15, 24. Disadvantages: Compared with structured meshes, it uses more memory15, and more cells may be required to obtain the same accuracy15. Mesh quality control (especially skewness and orthogonality) can be difficult14-16. Hybrid Mesh: Features: Combines the advantages of structured and unstructured meshes14, 15, 24. For example, structured prism or hexahedral meshes are used for the boundary layer near the wall, and unstructured tetrahedral meshes are used for the remaining regions15, 24. Pyramid cells are often used to provide a natural transition between the prism/hexahedral region and the tetrahedral region15.

Turbulence models reduce the computational burden by averaging out the effects of turbulence or resolving only large eddies. The choice of a turbulence model depends on the flow characteristics (near the wall, free shear flow, etc.), the required accuracy, and the computational resources23, 24, 22. Main models: RANS (Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes): solves the time-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, modeling all-scale (small eddies) effects of turbulence. Computationally cheapest, but accuracy depends on the model20, 23, 22. Two-equation models (such as k-ε, k-ω, SST) based on the eddy viscosity hypothesis are the most widely used23, 24, 22. It is closely related to whether or not the wall function is used (the y+ value)17, 18. It may have limitations in predicting complex flows (e.g., strong eddies, separation)23, 22. RSM (Reynolds Stress Model): Attempts to overcome the isotropic assumption by solving a separate equation for the Reynolds stress without using the eddy viscosity hypothesis. It is more accurate than the RANS two-equation model, but is more computationally expensive23, 22. URANS (Unsteady RANS): Solves the time-averaged RANS equations, but captures large-scale unsteady phenomena (e.g., eddy shedding) by including time variation. More expensive than RANS, but cheaper than LES/DNS. LES (Large Eddy Simulation): It directly calculates large-scale eddies and models only the effects of eddies on a scale smaller than the grid size (Sub-grid Scale, SGS). It provides much higher accuracy than RANS and is advantageous for unsteady flow analysis, but it tends to be used only for specific research purposes20, 17, 23, 24, 22. Very fine grids may be required for near-wall resolution (y+≈1)17. DES (Detached Eddy Simulation) / SAS (Scale Adaptive Simulation): It is a hybrid model that combines RANS and LES. It behaves like RANS near the wall, and like LES in shear layer separation regions or free flow17. It is less computationally expensive than LES, but can show similar accuracy to LES in separated flows, etc. The grid requirements near the wall vary by model, but y+≈1 is often recommended17. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS): Directly resolves all scales of turbulence (down to the smallest Kolmogorov scale). Most accurate, but exponentially more computationally expensive, so it is used only for simple flow studies with low Reynolds numbers17-20. Very fine grids (y+≤1, x+≤15, z+≤15) are required for wall resolution17. Comparison and selection: RANS &lt; URANS &lt; DES/SAS &lt; LES &lt; DNS, with increasing computational cost but generally improving accuracy. In practical applications, the optimal turbulence model should be selected by referring to prior studies or experimental data, taking into account the analysis objectives, flow characteristics, and available computational resources24. In particular, when near-wall resolution is important, it is essential to generate a boundary layer grid that matches the y+ requirement of the selected turbulence model17, 18, 22.",

"CFD Pre-processing (Pre-processing) The pre-processing stage of CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulation is the process of completing all the initial settings required for analysis, from preparing the geometry of the analysis target to defining the calculation domain, creating the mesh, setting the physical model and boundary conditions, and entering the initial data. This stage is very important because it is the process of converting a complex real-world problem into a numerical model that the CFD solver can understand and calculate, and it has a critical impact on the accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency of the analysis results22, 24. In order to obtain reliable CFD results, it is essential to set each pre-processing element accurately and systematically22, 24.1-1. Reference &amp; Geometry (Reference and Geometry Definition) This is the stage of preparing and organizing the basic geometry for analysis. The accuracy of this stage directly affects the reliability of the subsequent analysis results. Geometry Creation &amp; CAD Interface Compatibility (Geometry Creation &amp; CAD Interface Compatibility) Concept: Geometry for CFD analysis is generally based on a 3D CAD (Computer-Aided Design) model. Geometry data generated from external modeling software such as AutoCAD, SolidWorks, CATIA, Revit, Rhino used in various fields such as architecture, machinery, and aerospace are imported into CFD software through standard file formats such as IGES (. igs), STEP (. stp), SAT (. sat), and Parasolid (. x_t)24.Importance: During this process, issues such as file format compatibility and the possibility of information loss during data conversion can arise. Therefore, CFD software must support various CAD file formats, and if necessary, data conversion tools or plug-ins with CAD model repair and simplification functions or dedicated preprocessing tools (e.g. ANSYS SpaceClaim, SimLab) are important24. Smooth data exchange greatly improves the efficiency of preprocessing work.Dimension Measurement and Internal Structure IdentificationConcept: In order to ensure the accuracy of CFD simulation, it is essential to accurately identify the physical dimensions and internal structures (channels, cavities, reinforcements, etc.) of the analysis target. This can be obtained from a variety of sources, including actual part measurements, 2D drawings, and 3D CAD models.Importance: Accurate geometric information is the starting point for setting up the correct computational domain, defining boundary conditions, and obtaining realistic analysis results. Particularly for complex internal flow analyses, detailed dimensions of all channels and connections are required.CAD cleanup and geometry repairConcept: Models produced by most commercial CAD software are often not &#39;closed&#39; or &#39;watertight&#39; solid geometries required for CFD analysis. In order to proceed with the analysis, it is necessary to detect and correct topology errors in the CAD model1, 25. These errors cause mesh generation failure or low-quality mesh. Major defects: Free Edges: The most common error where gaps occur because faces are not properly connected1. Non-manifold Edges/Vertices: Three or more faces share an edge or faces are physically connected at a vertex. Overlapping Surfaces/Volumes: Errors where faces or volumes overlap each other. Small Edges/Faces/Sliver Faces: Elements that are very small and cause problems during mesh generation. Inconsistent Normals: The normal vector directions of faces are inconsistent. Healing techniques: Professional CAD preprocessing tools (e.g. ANSYS SpaceClaim, ANSA, HyperMesh) or some CFD software built-in tools. It performs tasks such as filling free edges (Fill Hole), reconstructing damaged surfaces (Surface Wrapper), and correcting Boolean operation errors1, 2. It is ideal to correct problems in the original CAD through collaboration with the CAD group2. Practical application: For complex CAD models, the defect healing process can take up a significant portion (up to 80% or more) of the overall preprocessing time3. Geometry simplificationConcept: It is the process of removing or simplifying unnecessary detailed geometry (such as fillets, chamfers, small holes, bolts, logos, etc.) to a level that suits the purpose of the CFD analysis1-4, 22, 24. These detailed features have a minimal effect on the flow, but they increase the mesh count explosively and reduce computational efficiency. For example, in a building model, roof decorations, small protrusions, etc. that are irrelevant to the simulation purpose should be removed to avoid mesh generation errors and shorten the calculation time24. Importance: Simplification can reduce the difficulty of mesh generation, and reduce the number of meshes, which can greatly save computational resources (time, memory)1-4, 22, 24. This is especially important in the design optimization process that requires hundreds or thousands of simulations5. Technique: Detail Suppression: A technique that connects models by deleting small holes, fillets, etc. and expanding adjacent faces4. Sensitivity Analysis can be used to systematically simplify the parts that have less influence on the flow by determining them4. Feature Removal: A function to remove certain types of features (e.g., Ribs, Stiffeners) all at once. Idealization: A technique to replace complex 3D structures with 2D cross sections or 1D lines (e.g., modeling a pipe network with 1D lines). Level of Detail (LOD) management: An appropriate balance of level of detail (LOD) simplification, hybrid blocking, and hierarchical geometry handling techniques are suggested for efficient handling of complex geometries25. Considerations: Simplification should be performed considering the analysis objective4, 24, and parts that affect the core flow characteristics (e.g., airfoil leading edge, nozzle throat) should be maintained.1-2. Domain &amp; Part Definition (Calculation Domain &amp; Part Definition) This is the step of defining the space (computational domain) where CFD analysis will be performed and logically dividing and managing this domain. Fluid Domain Extraction &amp; Computational Domain Definition (Fluid Domain Extraction &amp; Computational Domain Definition) Fluid volume extraction concept: CAD models are usually composed of solid parts. Since CFD analysis targets the space where the fluid flows, the area occupied by the fluid (Fluid Domain or Internal Volume) must be separated and extracted from this solid shape6-8. For External Flow analysis, a virtual external region (bounding box or external domain) surrounding the analysis target object is created and the fluid domain is defined by excluding the object solid volume from this region. Computational domain definition and size: The computational domain defines the spatial extent in which the fluid flow will be simulated, and its size is very important as it directly affects the accuracy of the analysis results23, 24. The boundary surface should be set wide enough to avoid artificial influence on the physics22, 23. **International guidelines and academic research recommendations**22-24: Single building external flow: Generally, the distance from the flow inlet to the building is recommended to be at least **5H** of the representative height (H) of the building, **15H** to the rear exit of the building, and **5H** to the side and top boundaries. Group of buildings external flow: The above criteria are applied based on the tallest building (Hmax) in the domain, and the Blockage Ratio (the ratio of the building front projection area to the domain cross-sectional area) should be within **3%** to minimize artificial air acceleration and distortion. can be. When setting the computational domain, it is necessary to consider computational efficiency by adjusting the level of detail according to the distance, including the surrounding buildings, structures, and terrain that can affect the main flow.24. Method: Most preprocessing software provides the function to automatically extract the internal or external fluid region based on the solid shape6-8. This is often done by utilizing Boolean operations or solidifying the surface after extraction. Note: The extracted fluid volume becomes the actual computational domain for mesh generation. If the consistency issue of the CAD model is not resolved during this process, the fluid volume extraction may fail or an incomplete (with holes) volume may be generated. It is important to extract only the fluid regions that are required for the analysis purpose accurately. Zone/Part naming and definition (Zone/Part naming, partitioning) Concept: The process of dividing the extracted fluid domain and interface into logical zones or parts by function and location and naming them9-11. Importance: Clear definition of zones/parts facilitates subsequent steps such as setting boundary conditions12 (e.g., assigning a velocity condition to the inlet zone), applying material properties (e.g., applying aluminum properties to a specific solid part), controlling the mesh (e.g., creating a denser mesh for a specific zone), and analyzing and visualizing the results9. Strategy: Clearly distinguish and name the boundary surfaces: Inlet, Outlet, Wall, Symmetry Plane, Periodic Surface, etc.10. Volumes: Distinguish and name them: Fluid, Solid, Porous Zone, Rotating Zone, etc. Include location information: Include location or function information in the name, such as Inlet_Left, Wall_Top, Fluid_Core9. Use standard naming conventions: Within the project or organization Following a consistent naming convention helps collaboration and automation9. Automation: For complex models, there may be hundreds or thousands of faces and volumes, so automated naming and partitioning can often be done through scripting, etc.10. Symmetry and periodic conditionsConcept: When the geometry and the expected flow pattern are symmetric about a specific axis or plane or repeat in a specific direction12, 23, It is a technique to significantly reduce computational cost by analyzing only a portion of the model instead of the entire model12, 23. Symmetry: Used when the geometry and flow are symmetric about a plane12, 23. On the plane of symmetry, the normal velocity of the fluid is zero, and the normal gradient of all physical quantities is zero12, 23. Application: It can be used in analysis of pipe flow with a circular cross section, flow around a symmetrical blade, etc. It is important to carefully consider whether the flow actually evolves symmetrically (e.g., turbulent flows can lose their symmetry under certain conditions). Periodic: Used when the geometry and flow repeat in a particular direction12, 23. Sets the flow variables on one periodic plane to have a constant relationship with the variables on the corresponding other periodic plane. Types: Translational Periodicity: Repeats by translation (e.g., heat exchanger fin arrays). Rotational Periodicity: Repeats by rotation (e.g., turbomachinery blade passages)13. Applications: Used to predict overall turbine/compressor performance by analyzing only one blade passage, to analyze a specific region of a multi-finned heat sink, etc. Considerations: When applying the periodic condition, the mesh structures of the pairs of periodic boundaries must be perfectly corresponding or compatible12.1-3. Mesh Generation: The process of dividing the fluid domain into a finite number of small computational elements (cells or elements). Mesh quality directly affects the accuracy, stability, and convergence of analysis results14-16, 25, 22, 28. Meshing is the foundation of analysis24, 22, 27. Structured / Unstructured / Hybrid Structured Mesh: Characteristics: It has a regular connection structure, and is mainly composed of square cells in 2D and hexahedral cells in 3D14, 15, 24. The neighboring information of each cell is managed as an index, so the memory usage is small15, and when the grid lines are aligned to the flow direction or boundary, the numerical diffusion is small, so the accuracy is high. Advantages: It is simple to implement, computationally efficient14, and uses less memory15. Easy to control mesh quality. Disadvantages: Difficult or impossible to generate for complex or irregular geometries14, 15, 24. Unstructured Mesh: Characteristics: There is no regular connection structure, and 2D is mainly composed of triangle cells and 3D is mainly composed of tetrahedral cells14, 15, 24. Polyhedral, pyramid, and prism cells are also used15, 24. Adjacent cell information must be explicitly stored15. For large-scale complex geometries such as city-scale, tetrahedral meshes are recommended because they are flexible and easy to generate24. Advantages: It is easy to automatically generate meshes for complex and arbitrary geometries14, 15, 24. Disadvantages: Compared with structured meshes, it uses more memory15, and more cells may be required to obtain the same accuracy15. Mesh quality control (especially skewness and orthogonality) can be difficult14-16. Hybrid Mesh: Characteristics: Combines the advantages of ordered and unordered meshes14, 15, 24. For example, ordered prism or hexahedral meshes are used in the boundary layer near the wall, and unordered tetrahedral meshes are used in the remaining regions15, 24. Pyramid cells are often used to provide a natural transition between the prism/hexahedral region and the tetrahedral region15. Advantages: It can efficiently construct meshes even for complex geometries15, and provides a structure that is particularly advantageous for boundary layer resolution. It can balance computational efficiency and geometry flexibility14. Disadvantage: It requires additional consideration in managing the interface between structured and unstructured grid regions and in generating transition cells. Mesh Resolution and Distribution Concept: Grid resolution refers to the size and distribution of cells and is an important trade-off between simulation accuracy and computational cost23, 24, 22. In particular, high resolution is required in areas where physical phenomena such as airflow separation or reattachment on building surfaces are accurately captured22. Nonuniform Grids: In general, a nonuniform grid scheme is efficient, where finer grids (smaller cells) are used in areas where physical gradients are high, such as walls or ground surfaces, and progressively coarser grids (larger cells) are used in areas where flow changes are low or towards the edge of the computational domain24, 22. Mesh Expansion/Stretching Ratio: It refers to the ratio of the size change between adjacent cells. Since abrupt size changes can cause numerical errors, it is generally recommended to keep the expansion ratio below 1.2 to 1.324, 22. Inflation layer (y+), Wall Mesh Treatment (Boundary layer mesh, y+, wall mesh treatment) Boundary layer mesh: Near the solid wall, there is a thin fluid layer called the boundary layer where the changes in velocity and other physical quantities are very large. In order to resolve this accurately, a very thin and dense mesh layer is created in the direction perpendicular to the wall17, 18, 22. This mesh layer is called the inflation layer or boundary layer mesh, and it usually consists of prism or hexahedral cells18, 24. y+(y-Plus): The nondimensional distance from the wall to the center of the nearest grid cell17, 18. It is defined as y+ = (yu*) / ν, where y is the physical distance from the wall, u* is the friction velocity (√(τw/ρ)), and ν is the kinematic viscosity17. The value of y+ is very important for the near-wall turbulence modeling strategy17, 18, and the recommended y+ range varies depending on the type of turbulence model17, 22: Low-Reynolds Number Models (no wall function / low Reynolds number approach): compute directly to the wall, resolving the entire boundary layer, especially the viscous sublayer. Accurate resolution requires y+ ≈ 1 or less17, 22 (e.g. some variants of the k-ω SST model, some variants of the Spalart-Allmaras model). High accuracy but very computationally expensive22. High-Reynolds Number Models (using wall functions/wall function approach): Model the complex region near the wall with a wall function, with the first cell center located in the logarithmic layer, typically recommended as 30 ≲ y+≲ 300 (or up to 50022)17, 18, 22. The viscous sublayer is not resolved directly. Computationally inexpensive, but may be less accurate for complex boundary layer flows22. (e.g. Standard k-ε, RNG k-ε, Standard k-ω) DES/SAS (hybrid model): Models near the wall like RANS, and elsewhere like LES, typically requiring y+≈1, but the RANS region can use wall functions, so y+&gt;30 can be acceptable17. Which approach to use depends on the simulation objectives (e.g., whether wall shear stress or heat transfer calculations are important) and the available computational resources22. Overset / Cut-Cell / IB (Overlapped Mesh, Cut-Cell Mesh, Immersed Boundary Method) Overset Mesh (Chimera Grid / Overlapped Mesh): A technique that generates multiple grid sets that overlap each other and exchanges information through data interpolation in the overlapping region3, 4. It is advantageous for analyzing geometries with complex or relative motion (e.g., interaction between aircraft wings and fuselage, rotating propellers)3, 4. It offers high flexibility because the optimal grid can be generated independently for each component and then combined3, 4. Cut-Cell / Immersed Boundary: Unlike the body-fitted mesh, this is a technique to &#39;immerse&#39; the geometry in a fixed grid (usually a Cartesian grid). The boundary conditions are handled in the cut cell or the grid near the geometry14. The mesh generation process is very fast and easy to automate, but there may be difficulties in accuracy near the geometry or handling complex boundary conditions. IB (Immersed Boundary Method) has strengths in modeling flexible boundaries (e.g. biofluids). Adaptive mesh (h-/p-/r-/hp-) (Adaptive mesh) Concept: This is a technique to automatically modify the mesh based on the intermediate results of the analysis (e.g. velocity gradient, pressure rate of change, vorticity, residual), refining areas with insufficient resolution and coarsening areas with excessive resolution16. Minimize user intervention and improve computational efficiency and accuracy simultaneously16. Type: h-refinement: Reduce the grid size (h) by dividing an existing cell into several smaller cells16. This is the most commonly used technique. p-refinement: Increase the degree (p) of the interpolating polynomial used within the cell without changing the cell shape, thereby improving accuracy16. Mainly used in finite element method (FEM). r-refinement: A technique that redistributes the locations of grid nodes to concentrate more nodes in areas where flow characteristics are important. hp-refinement: A technique that combines h- and p-refinement. Quality indicators (skew, AR, orthogonality) (Grid quality indicators) Concept: A measure to evaluate the geometric quality of the generated mesh16, 24. A poor-quality mesh can reduce the accuracy of numerical analysis, reduce convergence, and even cause divergence14-16, 24. Commercial CFD software provides a mesh quality report, and cells with quality degradation beyond a certain threshold should be modified or removed16. Key indicators: Indicator Description Ideal valueCaution requiredCritical valueSkewness (asymmetry) An indicator of how distorted a cell shape is16. The degree to which it deviates from a regular polyhedron. 0.85 or more160.95 or moreAspect Ratio (aspect ratio) The ratio of the length of the longest side to the length of the shortest side of a cell16. Degree of anisotropy. 1100 or more16 (except for the boundary layer near the wall) Extreme valuesOrthogonalityThe angle between the vector connecting the centers of neighboring cells and the common surface normal vector16.90° (expressed as 0° or 1 in some software)Less than 15° or more than 75° (less than 0.15 by some software)16, 240° (less than 0.01 by some software)Other metrics: Volume Ratio, Mesh Expansion Ratio (mesh growth rate, generally recommended to be less than 1.2 to 1.322, 24). In particular, it is important to properly control the growth rate in the direction normal to the wall in the boundary layer grid.Mesh Independence Study (Grid Convergence Study)Concept: A procedure performed to evaluate the effect of mesh resolution on simulation results and to ensure the reliability of the results23. This is the process of performing simulations under the same conditions using different grid resolutions (at least three are recommended, e.g., coarse, medium, fine) and comparing the changes in key analytical physical quantities (e.g., velocity at a specific point, pressure, total drag coefficient, etc.)23. Importance: When the result change due to the grid resolution converges within a certain tolerance, such that the result no longer changes significantly even if the mesh is refined further, then that resolution (or a slightly coarser resolution) is considered grid-independent and used for the final simulation23. This is a key method for evaluating the error due to grid resolution among numerical uncertainties23, 28. Procedure: Typically, the grid size is gradually increased (e.g., the number of cells is increased by 1.5 to 2 times in each direction) and the results are compared. Methods such as Richardson Extrapolation are also used to quantitatively estimate the order of convergence and discretization error.1-4. Boundary Conditions (Boundary Conditions) This is the step to define the behavior of flow variables (velocity, pressure, temperature, etc.) at the boundaries (entrance, outlet, wall, etc.) of the computational domain12, 23, 24, 22, 27. This simulates actual physical situations and is a key factor that affects the analysis results19. Inlet (Inlet Conditions: Velocity, Flow Rate) Concept: This is the boundary where the fluid flows into the computational domain. Typically specifies the velocity, pressure, temperature, turbulence characteristics, etc. of the incoming fluid12, 23, 22. Type: Velocity Inlet: Directly specifies the magnitude and direction of the incoming velocity vector12, 23. Depending on the turbulence model, turbulence intensity or length scale must also be specified. Mass Flow Inlet: Specifies the mass flow rate of the incoming fluid12, 23. Also used with pressure conditions. Pressure Inlet: Specifies the total pressure or static pressure of the incoming fluid19, 23. Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) Inlet Conditions (Outdoor Wind Simulation)23, 22: The wind speed profile in the atmospheric boundary layer represents the variation of wind speed with height, and the following model is commonly used: Power Law: v(z) = vref * (z / zref) α (where v(z) is the wind speed at height z, vref is the wind speed at a reference height zref, and α is a function of ground roughness, which is determined by the Exponent. For example, rural 0.15, urban 0.2223, 22). Log distribution (Log Law): v(z) = (u*/κ) * ln(z/z0), where u* is the friction velocity, κ is the Karman constant (approximately 0.41), and z0 is the surface roughness length23, 22). The turbulent kinetic energy (k) and the turbulent dissipation rate (ε) or specific dissipation rate (ω) profiles must also be specified. Considerations: The inlet conditions should be set to resemble the actual flow situation as closely as possible. It is important to accurately simulate incompletely developed flows or complex inlet profiles. In indoor simulations, uniform velocity or flow rates are often used, such as at the fan outlet24. It is recommended to set boundary conditions based on actual experimental or field data, and sufficient domain margin should be ensured at the boundaries for conditions with high uncertainty23. Outlet (pressure condition) Concept: The boundary where the fluid leaves the computational domain. Specifies the pressure of the outflowing fluid12, 23, 24, 22. Type: Pressure Outlet: Specifies the static pressure of the outflowing fluid12, 19, 23, 24. Temperature and turbulence information for the outflowing fluid can also be specified. You must specify how backflow will be handled. Outflow: Calculates outflow based on conservation of mass and assumes fully developed flow at the outlet19, 23. The gradient of physical quantities toward the outlet is set to zero. Can be used with Mass flow inlet, but may not be suitable when recirculation occurs. Mass Flow Outlet: Specifies the mass flow rate of the outflowing fluid. Pressure Far-Field: Used at the external boundary in compressible flow analyses and specifies the far-field pressure and Mach number19. Considerations: It is important to set the outlet conditions so that the flow escapes naturally. Incorrect outlet conditions can cause unphysical pressure waves or reflections inside the computational domain. For outlets where recirculation is expected, the Pressure Outlet condition is more appropriate than the Outflow condition, and the outlet boundary should be sufficiently far away from the area of interest22. Wall (Wall Condition: No-slip Moving) Concept: Boundary where a fluid contacts a solid surface12, 23, 22. Type: Stationary Wall (No-slip): The most common wall condition, which assumes zero fluid velocity at the wall (sticky condition)12, 23, 22. Moving Wall: Used when the wall is moving (e.g., conveyor belt, rotating drum). Specify the wall velocity12. Slip Wall (Free Slip): It is assumed that only the normal velocity is zero and the tangential velocity is not zero at the wall (zero shear stress). It can be used when the viscosity is very small or the boundary layer effects can be ignored, or for the special case of a plane of symmetry (similar to the Symmetry condition). Considerations: It is important to accurately reflect the physical properties of the actual wall, such as roughness24, 22, temperature, and heat flux. In turbulence analysis, near-wall flow modeling (y+ and wall functions) and wall condition setting are closely related17, 18, 22. Symmetry / Periodic / UDF (Symmetry / Periodic / User-Defined Function Condition)Symmetry: Symmetric surface boundary condition described in 1-212, 23. It reduces the computational domain and improves efficiency when the physical phenomenon is symmetric.Periodic: Boundary condition for periodic repetitive structures described in 1-212, 13, 23.UDF (User Defined Function): A function that allows users to define specific boundary conditions or physical models by writing their own C or C++ code12. It is used to model complex or non-standard situations that are difficult to simulate with standard boundary conditions (e.g., complex inlet velocity profiles that vary over time, valves that are activated only under certain conditions). Other conditions: There are various boundary conditions for modeling specific physical phenomena, such as fan conditions and internal porous media conditions23, 24.1-5. Physics Model Selection (Physics Model Selection) This is the step of selecting the appropriate governing equations and auxiliary models based on the physical characteristics (state, velocity, temperature change, etc.) of the target flow to be analyzed20. Understanding flow characteristics: Laminar vs. Turbulent: Distinguish whether the flow is stable (laminar) where the viscous effect of the fluid dominates, or flow where irregular eddies occur (turbulent) due to inertial effects20, 22. It is judged based on the Reynolds number (Re = ρVL / μ)20. If Re is low, it is laminar, and if it is high, it is turbulent. Steady vs. Unsteady: Distinguish whether it is steady-state flow where flow variables (velocity, pressure, etc.) do not change over time20, or unsteady-state flow where the flow changes over time20. Steady flow is solved by solving equations that do not have a time term, while unsteady flow is solved at each time step through time integration. Compressible vs. Incompressible: Whether the density change of the fluid is negligible (incompressible, usually liquids or slow gases with Mach numbers &lt; 0.3)20 or whether density change is significant and should be taken into account (compressible, usually high-speed gases with Mach numbers &gt; 0.3)20. Equation of state is essential for analyzing compressible flows20. Other characteristics: Determine whether physical phenomena such as heat transfer, multiphase flow (liquid-gas, liquid-solid mixtures, etc.), chemical reactions, radiative heat transfer, and phase changes occur. Turbulence Models ( Steady RANS - URANS - DES - LES - DNS ) Concept: Turbulent flows are irregular and contain eddies on a large scale, so directly resolving all scales is impossible with most existing computational resources. Turbulence models reduce the computational burden by averaging out the effects of turbulence or resolving only large eddies. The choice of turbulence model is based on the flow characteristics (near the wall, free shear flow, etc.), the required accuracy, and the computational resources23, 24, 22. Main models:RANS (Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes): solves the Navier-Stokes equations averaged over time, modeling the effects of turbulence at all scales (small eddies). Computationally cheapest, but accuracy depends on the model20, 23, 22. Two-equation models (such as k-ε, k-ω, SST) based on the eddy viscosity hypothesis are the most widely used23, 24, 22. It is closely related to whether or not the wall function is used (the y+ value)17, 18. It may have limitations in predicting complex flows (e.g., strong eddies, separation)23, 22. RSM (Reynolds Stress Model): Attempts to overcome the isotropic assumption by solving a separate equation for the Reynolds stress without using the eddy viscosity hypothesis. It is more accurate than the RANS two-equation model, but is more computationally expensive23, 22. URANS (Unsteady RANS): Solves the time-averaged RANS equations, but captures large-scale unsteady phenomena (e.g., eddy shedding) by including time variation. More expensive than RANS, but cheaper than LES/DNS. LES (Large Eddy Simulation): It directly calculates large-scale eddies and models only the effects of eddies on a scale smaller than the grid size (Sub-grid Scale, SGS). It provides much higher accuracy than RANS and is advantageous for unsteady flow analysis, but it tends to be used only for specific research purposes20, 17, 23, 24, 22. Very fine grids may be required for near-wall resolution (y+≈1)17. DES (Detached Eddy Simulation) / SAS (Scale Adaptive Simulation): It is a hybrid model that combines RANS and LES. It behaves like RANS near the wall, and like LES in shear layer separation regions or free flow17. It is less computationally expensive than LES, but can show similar accuracy to LES in separated flows, etc. Near-wall mesh requirements vary by model, but y+≈1 is often recommended17. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS): Directly resolves all scales of turbulence (down to the smallest Kolmogorov scale). Most accurate, but exponentially more computationally expensive, so it is used only for simple flow studies with low Reynolds numbers17-20. Very fine meshes (y+≤1, x+≤15, z+≤15) are required for wall resolution17. Comparison and selection: In the following order: RANS &lt; URANS &lt; DES/SAS &lt; LES &lt; DNS, with increasing computational cost but generally improving accuracy. In practical applications, the optimal turbulence model should be selected by referring to prior studies or experimental data, taking into account the analysis objectives, flow characteristics, and available computational resources24. Especially when near-wall flow resolution is important, it is essential to generate a boundary layer grid that matches the y+ requirements of the chosen turbulence model17, 18, 22. Multiphase (VOF, CLSVOF, Euler-Euler …)Concept: Models flows where two or more phases (liquids, gases, solid particles, etc.) are mixed. Main models:VOF (Volume of Fluid): Used to track the free surface or interface between immiscible phases. It computes the volume fraction occupied by each phase within each cell.CLSVOF (Coupled Level Set and VOF): Combines VOF and Level Set methods to improve the accuracy of interface tracking.Eulerian-Eulerian: Treats each phase as a continuum, solves the momentum and continuity equations for each phase separately, and models their interactions. Suitable for interpenetrating flows or dispersed phase flows (bubbles, droplets, particles). Eulerian-Lagrangian: Models both the background fluid phase, which is considered as a continuum, and discrete phases such as particles/droplets/bubbles. Tracks the trajectories of particles and calculates their interactions with the fluid. (Discrete Phase Model, DPM) Heat, Radiation, Reaction (Conduction ~ Radiation) Concepts: Models physical phenomena such as heat transfer (convection, conduction, radiation), chemical reactions, and phase changes that occur in a fluid system. Main Models: Heat Transfer Models: Activates the energy equation to calculate the temperature distribution. Conduction: Models heat diffusion through a medium. Convection: Models heat transfer by moving fluid (this is included in the flow equations themselves). Radiation: Models heat transfer in the form of electromagnetic waves (e.g. solar radiation, radiation from hot surfaces). There are various radiation models such as DO (Discrete Ordinates), P1, S2S (Surface-to-Surface), etc. Species Transport / Reaction Models: Models mixing, diffusion, and chemical reactions of multicomponent fluids. Used for combustion, pollutant production, etc. Phase Change Models: Models phase change phenomena such as evaporation, condensation, melting, and solidification. 1-6. Material &amp; Initial Data This is the step to define the physical properties of the fluid and solid regions to be analyzed, and to set the flow field state at the start of the calculation. 20. Fluid and solid properties (ρ, μ, Cp, k, EOS), non-Newtonian concepts: The governing equations of CFD analysis (mass, momentum, energy conservation equations) include material properties that represent the physical characteristics of the fluid. Accurate input of material properties directly affects the reliability of the analysis results21, 22, 24. Main material properties (fluid): Density (ρ): Mass divided by unit volume21. It is considered constant in incompressible flow, but changes depending on pressure/temperature/component in compressible flow and is defined by the equation of state (EOS)20, 22, 24. Viscosity (μ): Resistance to fluid flow17. Related to internal friction and determines the viscous effects of the flow (especially the boundary layer). It is often a function of temperature21, 22, 24. Specific Heat at Constant Pressure (Cp): The heat energy required to raise the temperature of unit mass of a substance by unit temperature under constant pressure21, 22, 24. Essential for heat transfer analysis. Thermal Conductivity (k): The ease with which heat is conducted through a substance17, 22, 24. Determines the rate of heat transfer due to a temperature gradient. EOS (Equation of State): Defines the relationship between pressure, temperature, and density20. The Ideal Gas Law is a representative example. Essential for compressible flow analysis. Key Material Properties (Solid): The thermal conductivity, density, and specific heat of the solid region are required for heat transfer analysis. Wall roughness, and emissivity are also considered for radiation analysis24. Non-Newtonian: Fluids whose viscosity changes with shear rate (e.g. blood, polymer solutions, paint). The linear proportional relationship between shear stress and shear rate (Newtonian fluid) does not hold, and special models such as Power Law and Carreau model must be applied. Data source: Commercial CFD software usually provides a built-in material library, but special materials must be defined manually using experimental data or literature research24. Initial field (velocity, pressure, scalar) Concept: It is to set the initial values of flow variables (velocity, pressure, temperature, turbulence variables, scalar variables such as mass fractions of components) for all cells in the computational domain at the beginning of the computation (time t = 0)20, 22. Importance: The initial value setting affects the convergence rate of steady analysis20, and directly affects the flow field at the initial moment in unsteady analysis22. Set it to reflect the actual initial conditions (e.g., stationary state, uniform flow, etc.). Method: It is common to set all variables to zero (stationary state) or initialize them uniformly, which is the same as the inlet conditions. In complex analyses, the results of simple steady analyses are often used as initial fields to accelerate convergence. 1-7. Dimensionless Scaling Rather than a step in the CFD analysis setup itself, it is closely related to the preprocessing step as an analysis tool that helps to identify the characteristics of the target flow and select an appropriate physical model. By calculating representative dimensionless numbers, the dominant physical phenomenon of the flow is determined, and the analysis setup is reviewed based on this. 20. Re (Reynolds number): The ratio of inertial and viscous forces 20. It is a major criterion for determining laminar-turbulent transition and turbulent flow characteristics. The higher the Re value, the more dominant the turbulent effect. (Re = ρVL / μ) Pr (Prandtl number): The ratio of momentum diffusivity to thermal diffusivity. It indicates the relative thickness of the velocity boundary layer and the temperature boundary layer in the fluid. (Pr = Cpμ / k) Fr (Froude number): The ratio of inertial and gravity forces. It is used to determine the degree of gravity influence in flows that include a free surface (e.g., open-channel flow, waves). (Fr = V / √(gL))We (Weber number): Ratio of inertial force to surface tension. Used to judge the importance of surface tension in free surface flow or droplet/bubble flow. (We = ρV2L / σ, where σ is surface tension)St (Strouhal number): Ratio of unsteady frequency scale to convective scale. Characteristics of unsteady periodic phenomena such as eddy shedding. (St = fL / V, where f is frequency)Ma (Mach number): Ratio of flow velocity to sound speed20. It is a main criterion for judging the degree of compressibility effect on the flow. It is generally considered to be incompressible when Ma &lt; 0.320. (Ma = V / a, a is the speed of sound)Use: By calculating these dimensionless numbers, we can figure out in advance whether the flow is laminar or turbulent, compressible or incompressible, etc.20, and use them to determine the physical model in steps 1-5 (type of turbulence model, compressibility activation, etc.) and the grid strategy in steps 1-3 (especially y+ criteria). For example, if the calculated Re number is much larger than the critical Re number, the turbulence model must be activated20, and if the calculated Ma number is more than 0.3, the compressible flow model must be selected20.1-8. Key Error Control and Verification in Pre-processing Errors in the pre-processing stage can seriously affect the reliability of the final simulation results, so systematic error control and verification procedures are essential23. Follow Best Practice Guidelines: It is important to refer to and apply international recommendations (e.g., ERCOFTAC Best Practice Guidelines, AIAA Guidelines, ASCE Guidelines28) such as appropriate mesh design, sufficient domain size, and reliable boundary condition setting23, 28. Understand physical and numerical uncertainties: Physical uncertainty: It arises from simplification of physical models (e.g., limitations of turbulence models), incorrect or incomplete boundary conditions, and uncertainty in material properties23. Numerical uncertainty: It arises from discretization error (depending on grid resolution and differencing method), convergence error (iteration error, incomplete convergence of iterations), and programming errors23. The grid independence test (1-3-7) is a key method for evaluating the discretization error due to grid resolution among numerical uncertainties23, 28. Use of a checklist: It is useful for securing practical reliability to systematically check the accuracy of geometric modeling, satisfaction of grid quality indicators, validity of boundary conditions and initial conditions, accuracy of material data, consistency of unit system, data compatibility, etc. by using a checklist at each preprocessing step28. Visual review: It is also important to visually closely examine the generated grid, applied boundary conditions, etc. to find obvious errors or inappropriate settings.1-9. Advancements and Automation Trends in Pre-processing Technology The CFD pre-processing process is still recognized as a bottleneck that requires a lot of manual work and expert experience, and active research is being conducted to improve it25, 26. Automation and workflow improvement: Scripting and parametric modeling: Automate repetitive pre-processing tasks and facilitate model updates according to design variable changes. BIM (Building Information Modeling) data linkage: In the architectural field, attempts are being made to develop technologies to automate pre-processing processes such as geometry simplification, calculation domain setting, and boundary condition assignment by linking BIM data with CFD26. This focuses on significantly reducing work time and ensuring user convenience and consistency26. Integrated environment: CAD, mesh generation, solver settings, etc. are performed in a single integrated environment to reduce data conversion errors and streamline the workflow. AI/machine learning (ML)-based application: Research is underway to accelerate or automate the preprocessing process by utilizing machine learning techniques25, 27, 29, 30. Shape recognition and automatic simplification: Research to automatically identify, remove, or simplify unnecessary features in CAD models by applying image recognition technology. Automatic mesh generation and quality improvement: Technology to recommend the optimal mesh distribution or parameters for a specific shape or automatically improve the quality of the generated mesh by learning past mesh generation data or flow characteristics25, 29. Boundary condition estimation: Attempts to utilize ML models to estimate realistic boundary conditions from limited information29. Data quality control: Since the quality of preprocessing data (mesh, boundary, initial value, etc.) has a critical impact on the ML prediction results, data standardization and quality control are becoming important25, 28. High performance Leverage HPC: Reduce meshing time for very large and complex models through massive parallel processing. Improved meshing techniques: More efficient and robust meshing techniques are continuously being developed, such as polyhedral meshing, advances in adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), and improved usability of overset mesh techniques. These latest research trends are contributing to improving the overall simulation process by increasing the efficiency and reliability of the CFD preprocessing step.

"CFD Solving (Analysis Execution)The &quot;Solving&quot; step of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a key procedure that numerically approximates and solves the partial differential equation (PDE) system that governs the actual fluid flow phenomenon based on the geometric shape, grid, physical model settings, and boundary conditions prepared in the pre-processing step. In this step, a large-scale algebraic equation system is constructed through the selected numerical analysis technique, and physical solutions such as flow field, temperature field, pressure field, and chemical species concentration distribution are derived through an iterative calculation process [1], [2]. In order to obtain accurate and reliable analysis results, it is important to select and apply appropriate numerical analysis techniques and physical models that are suitable for the characteristics of the problem. This document explains in detail the main classification system of the CFD analysis execution steps, such as numerical analysis techniques, turbulence models, multiphase flow models, chemical reaction models, heat transfer models, dynamic mesh/moving boundary problem handling techniques, verification and validation (V&amp;V), and the latest research trends, and compares and analyzes the principles, advantages and disadvantages, and application fields of each concept and model to provide in-depth information to experts and learners. 1. Numerical Methods Various techniques are used to numerically solve partial differential equations, including the Navier-Stokes equations that govern fluid flow in CFD. They discretize the computational domain and convert differential equations into an algebraic equation system so that they can be processed by a computer. Representative techniques include the finite difference method (FDM), the finite volume method (FVM), the finite element method (FEM), and the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) [1], [2], [4], [5]. 1.1 Finite Difference Method (FDM) Theory and Features: FDM is the most intuitive numerical analysis technique that approximates each differential term of a differential equation using a Taylor series expansion [36], [37]. It divides the computational domain into regular grid points and approximates the differential value using the differences in values at neighboring grid points, thereby transforming the governing equation into an algebraic equation system. As the grid spacing decreases, the approximation error decreases, which increases the accuracy of the solution [36]. Advantages: It is widely used for basic research or educational purposes because it has a simple theoretical background and is relatively easy to implement [36], [37]. It is efficient for simple geometries and boundary conditions. Disadvantages: It is difficult to apply to complex geometries or irregular grids. In particular, for irregular grids other than square or rectangular grids, the differential term approximation becomes complicated or impossible [36], [37]. In addition, there is a limitation that the conservation laws of physical quantities (mass, momentum, etc.) cannot be strictly satisfied in each computational cell [37], [37]. Application area: It is mainly applied to problems with simple geometries or problems using structured grid systems (e.g., simple heat transfer, 1D/2D flow problems) [36], [37]. 1.2 Finite Volume Method (FVM) Theory and characteristics: FVM is the most widely used technique in CFD. It discretizes the computational domain into several finite control volumes and integrates the conservation laws in the form of governing equations for each control volume [37], [38], [37]. Since the integration of the conservation equations is achieved by balancing the physical quantity flux passing through the boundary of each control volume, it has the strong advantage of automatically satisfying the conservation of physical quantities [37], [38]. Advantages: It has strict physical quantity conservation and can be flexibly applied to irregular grids of various shapes such as tetrahedrons and hexahedrons, so it is very effective for problems with complex shapes [37], [38], [37]. Most commercial CFD software used in the industry (such as ANSYS FLUENT, OpenFOAM) is based on FVM [37], [45]. Disadvantages: Compared to FDM, the discretization process is complex and the difficulty of code implementation is relatively high [37]. In particular, it is important to secure numerical stability when applying high-order interpolation techniques to accurately calculate complex boundary flow. Application areas: It is standardly applied to complex flow, heat transfer, combustion, and multiphase flow problems in almost all industries and research fields such as aerospace, automobiles, machinery, chemistry, energy, and the environment [37], [38]. 1.3 Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) Theory and Features: Unlike conventional CFD techniques, LBM approaches the fluid from a microscopic perspective. It obtains macroscopic fluid behavior (density, velocity, pressure, etc.) by calculating the temporal evolution of the particle distribution function defined on a specific grid system [39], [40]. At each time step, the particle distribution function within the grid point is locally redistributed during the collision phase, and the particle distribution function moves to the neighboring grid point during the streaming phase, repeating the process [39]. Through this, the solution to the Navier–Stokes equation can be obtained indirectly. Advantages: The algorithm structure is simple, and the calculation at each grid point is local, so it is very advantageous for parallel calculation, and it shows high efficiency when utilizing parallel hardware such as GPU [39], [40], [39]. It is relatively easy to handle complex boundary conditions (solid boundaries, free surfaces, porous media), and it is particularly strong in the analysis of multiphase flow and microfluid flow [39]. Disadvantages: The theoretical connection with the traditional conservation equation-based analysis is not direct, and there may be limitations in the Mach number and Reynolds number regions [39], [40]. In particular, there are still limitations in the analysis of compressible flow or shock waves [39]. Compared to FVM, it has a short history and research base, so it is relatively less mature in terms of general-purpose physical models (especially high-performance turbulence models) and complex numerical techniques [39]. Application areas: It is increasingly being used in specific fields and research purposes such as microfluidics, multiphase flow (especially free surface flow), porous media flow, and biofluid flow [39], [39].

While FDM, FVM, and FEM directly discretize and solve the macroscopic continuum equations (Navier-Stokes), LBM indirectly derives the macroscopic flow characteristics by simulating the dynamics of microscopic particle distribution functions [1], [2], [4], [39]. Principle: LBM is based on statistical mechanics, and repeats the process of particles moving and colliding with a specific velocity within each grid cell. The average result of this process forms the macroscopic fluid flow (velocity, density) [1], [2], [4], [39]. On the other hand, FDM/FVM/FEM directly discretize the laws of conservation of mass, momentum and energy. Grid: LBM mainly operates on a regular lattice, and the direction of particle movement is restricted to the lattice direction [1], [12]. FDM is also suitable for regular lattices, but FVM and FEM are very flexible in handling complex irregular lattices [1], [2], [4], [10]. Accuracy and stability: Traditional FVM/FEM directly approximates the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations themselves, so it has better numerical accuracy and convergence, and it is easy to apply various boundary conditions [1]. LBM may have accuracy limitations in handling boundary conditions, but it shows sufficient performance in certain flows (such as multiphase, porous, etc.) [6]. Computational performance and parallelization: LBM focuses on local operations in each lattice cell, so it has very high parallelization efficiency [1], [4], [39]. It has strengths in large-scale parallel systems, and can show fast speed due to memory cache efficiency in small-scale problems [2]. FDM/FVM/FEM can also be parallelized, but may not be as simple as LBM. LBM consumes more memory bandwidth than FDM/FVM [2]. Performance may vary depending on hardware, code tuning, problem size, and error tolerance [2], [3]. Applications: LBM is suitable for microfluidics, multiphase/porous flows, and flows with complex boundaries, while FVM/FEM have been widely applied in various engineering fields such as aerospace, automotive, and marine [1], [4], [39]. FDM is widely used for simple geometries and educational purposes. Despite its theoretical simplicity, FVM is overwhelmingly dominant in industrial fields due to its complex geometry processing and preservation issues. LBM has strengths in parallel computing and specific types of complex boundary processing, and its application areas are gradually expanding [37], [39]. Other recent numerical techniques: Spectral methods have strengths in high-order accuracy, but weaknesses in complex boundary processing [1]. Recently, machine learning techniques (such as PINN) have been introduced to the CFD field to improve numerical analysis speed, improve modeling, and integrate physical laws [32]. Particle-based methods (such as SPH and MPS) are mesh-free and are applied to complex boundary and free surface flow, fracture phenomena, etc. [1]. 2. Turbulence Models Turbulence is an irregular and time-dependent flow phenomenon, and it is almost impossible to directly calculate eddies at all scales with current computational resources (except DNS). Therefore, turbulence effects are modeled and analyzed in CFD [1], [41], [42]. The major turbulence models can be divided into DNS, LES, and RANS families according to the computational approach, and hybrid models (such as DES) that are an intermediate form of these are also used [1], [2], [4], [5], [41]. The turbulence model is selected by considering the characteristics of the problem to be analyzed, the required accuracy, and the available computational resources. 2.1 DNS (Direct Numerical Simulation) Theory and assumptions: The Navier-Stokes equations are directly discretized and solved for all time and space scales of turbulence (including the smallest Kolmogorov scale) [41], [42]. No turbulence modeling is required. Advantages: It provides the most theoretically accurate turbulence analysis results, and the fundamental physical phenomena of turbulence can be identified without modeling errors [41]. Disadvantages: The required number of grids and time resolution are extremely high, resulting in enormous computational costs [41], [42]. It is hardly applicable to complex or real-scale problems. Scope of application: It is mainly used only for basic research purposes such as studying the physical characteristics of turbulence or generating verification data for other turbulence models [41]. 2.2 Large Eddy Simulation (LES) Theory and assumptions: Among turbulent eddies, eddies larger than the grid scale (Large Eddy) are directly calculated, and the influence of eddies smaller than the grid scale (Small Eddy or Subgrid Scale, SGS) is approximated using the SGS model [41], [42]. Advantages: It is much less computational cost than DNS, and it can predict realistic turbulent structures and unsteady characteristics better than the RANS model [41]. It is especially useful for analyzing flow phenomena dominated by eddies. Disadvantages: It still requires higher computational cost than the RANS model, and time-dependent analysis is essential [41]. The fine turbulent structure near the wall is difficult to compute directly, so the use of a wall model may be necessary [42]. Scope of application: It is applied to problems that fall between DNS and RANS, such as turbulence, unsteady flow, and mixing/combustion processes occurring in relatively complex geometries, or to medium- to large-scale research/industry [41]. 2.3 DES (Detached Eddy Simulation) Theory and assumptions: It is a hybrid model that combines the advantages of RANS and LES [41]. In the boundary layer region near the wall, the RANS model is applied to reduce the computational cost, and in the region where large eddies dominate, such as the separated flow or shear layer far from the wall, the LES model is applied to improve the accuracy [41]. Advantages: It provides a balance between the computational cost and accuracy between RANS and LES, and is especially efficient in analyzing complex separated flows such as separation or vortex shedding [41]. Disadvantages: There is a possibility of artificial numerical errors in the region where the model is switched from RANS to LES or vice versa, and the stability of the analysis results may vary depending on the model settings. Scope of application: It is used to solve complex separated flow problems at mesoscale, such as aerospace (stall analysis), automobile (external flow), and industrial engineering [41]. 2.4 RANS (Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes) and URANS (Unsteady RANS) Theory and assumptions: The Navier-Stokes equations are time-averaged to separate the turbulent fluctuation components, and the average The equations for the flow are derived [41], [42]. In this process, various turbulence models are used to approximate the unknown Reynolds Stress. There are Eddy Viscosity Models (e.g., k-epsilon, k-omega, Spalart-Allmaras) that assume the turbulent viscosity coefficient and Reynolds Stress Models (RSM) that solve the Reynolds Stress Transport Equation. URANS (Unsteady RANS): It adds time dependence to the RANS equation form, so it analyzes the time-varying mean flow (Unsteady Mean Flow) rather than the time-averaged flow. The turbulent fluctuations themselves are still modeled [42]. Advantages: It is the most commonly used in industry due to its low computational cost and excellent numerical stability compared to DNS and LES [41], [42]. It is suitable for rapid design and performance prediction of complex industrial problems. Disadvantage: It has limitations in predicting complex or unsteady turbulence phenomena because it averages out the detailed structure or unsteady characteristics of turbulence rather than directly calculating them [41]. Prediction accuracy may be poor in certain flows (e.g., strong eddies, separated flows). Scope of application: Widely used for steady or periodic unsteady mean flow analysis, such as aircraft external flow (cruise conditions), automotive aerodynamics, pipe flow, and heat exchangers [41], [45]. Model family / Model principle Features Accuracy Computational cost Application DNS (Direct Numerical Simulation) Direct calculation of all scales of turbulence (direct solution of the Navier-Stokes equations) [1], [2], [4], [41] No modeling, full turbulent energy spectrum resolution [1] Highest [1], [2], [4], [41] Very expensive [1], [2], [4], [41] Basic research, understanding of turbulent flow physics, validation of new models (hardly applicable to large-scale practical problems) [1], [2], [41] LES (Large Eddy Simulation) Direct calculation of large eddy, Small eddy modeling (Subgrid Model)[1],[2],[4],[41] About 80% resolution of turbulent energy spectrum[1], captures transient turbulent structure[1] High[1],[2],[4],[41] Expensive[1],[2],[4],[41] High accuracy required problems, complex industrial problems (e.g. aeroacoustics, wind turbines, vehicle aerodynamics)[1],[41] High grid resolution required near the wall[1],[42] DES (Detached Eddy Simulation) Combination of RANS and LES (RANS near the wall, LES far from the wall)[41] Switching between RANS and LES, trade-off between accuracy and computational cost[41] Higher than RANS, lower than LES (improved separation flow accuracy)[2],[4],[41] More expensive than RANS, cheaper than LES[1],[2],[4],[41] Difficulty in modeling walls in LES Complementary, flow separation/reattachment prediction, aerospace, wind, and ocean engineering[1],[2],[41]RANS (Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes) series, time-averaged Navier-Stokes equation analysis, turbulence effects modeling (mean flow prediction)[1],[41],[42], mean flow characteristic prediction[1]. URANS is a time-varying average flow analysis [42]. Relatively low (complex flow accuracy is poor) [1], [2], [4], [41] Cheapest [1], [2], [4], [41] Industry standard, large-scale analysis, indoor/outdoor air flow, general industrial flow (limited to reproduce detailed turbulent structure) [1], [2], [41] k-ε model Uses turbulent kinetic energy (k) and dissipation rate (ε) equations [1] High Reynolds number flow, useful for predicting free flow [1] Good (free flow) Cheap Flow inside a combustion chamber, free flow [1] k-ω model Uses turbulent kinetic energy (k) and specific dissipation rate (ω) equations [1] Good for predicting adverse pressure gradient flow, near the wall (boundary layer) [1], more accurate for transient flow [1] Good (near the wall, separated flow) Cheap Aerodynamic studies, separated flow [1] k-ω SST Combines the strengths of k-ε and k-ω (k-ω near the wall, k-ε works in free stream)[1] Uses blending functions[1] High performance (both near the wall and free stream)[1] Low cost Wide range of flow conditions (near the wall, free stream), jet flows, mixing/combustion[1] Guide to choosing a model: When you need the most accurate results but have unlimited computational resources: DNS (mostly impossible) When you need high accuracy and have ample computational resources (willing to pay a steep cost for near-wall resolution requirements): LES When you want relatively accurate results with reasonable computational resources (near-wall flow or separation prediction is important): Hybrid RANS-LES (such as DES) When large-scale industrial problems, fast solutions, and mean flow prediction are important: RANS (k-ω SST recommended) The accuracy of a turbulence model depends heavily on numerical factors such as grid quality and resolution, and time step size, in addition to the assumptions of the model itself[1]. 3. Multiphase Flow ModelsMultiphase flow refers to the flow of two or more phases mixed together, and the physical state (solid, liquid, gas) and chemical properties of each phase may be different. The multiphase flow model is a technique that simulates these interactions and the behavior of each phase using CFD [1], [2], [43]. It is largely divided into the Eulerian-Eulerian approach and the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach [1], [2], [43]. Each model is selected by considering the distribution shape of the phases, the importance of the interaction between the phases, and the computational cost. 3.1 VOF (Volume of Fluid) Model Theory and Features: This is a technique that traces a clear interface between immiscible fluids [43], [44]. It represents the distribution of the phases by calculating the volume fraction occupied by the corresponding phase within each computational cell [43]. All phases share a single momentum equation, and the volume fraction equation tracks the position and shape of the interface [43]. Advantages: It can model the motion and shape change of sharp phase boundaries relatively accurately [43]. It is suitable for analyzing free surface flow, filling, sloshing, and the motion of large drops/bubbles. It can be more computationally efficient than multifluid models. Disadvantages: It is difficult to apply to flows with complex interfacial interactions or finely dispersed phases, or it can significantly increase the computational cost due to the high resolution required [44]. The basic VOF model does not directly consider mass transfer between phases (e.g., evaporation, condensation), so additional modeling is required when phase change is important [44]. Applications: Oil-gas flow in petroleum pipelines, interfacial flow in boilers/condensers, free surfaces in wave/river flows, inkjet printing, and filling analysis in casting processes [43], [45]. 3.2 Mixture Model Theory and Features: This model assumes and analyzes multiphase flow as a single mixture [43], [46]. One momentum equation is solved for the average velocity and density of the mixture, and the relative velocity (slip velocity) between phases is approximated by an algebraic relationship (e.g., drift flux model) [43], [46]. Advantages: It is the most computationally efficient compared to the VOF model or Eulerian model [46]. It is suitable for flows where the phases are relatively evenly mixed or where the slip between phases is important but detailed interfacial tracking is unnecessary. It can be used to model phase changes (e.g., evaporation of dispersed droplets) [46]. Disadvantages: It is difficult to accurately model the detailed geometry of the phase boundary or complex interactions between phases [43]. It is not suitable for flows where the phases are largely separated or where the local equilibrium assumption is not valid. Applications: It is used for flows containing dispersed droplets/particles (e.g., sprays, particle transport), gas-liquid mixed flows with slight slip, and some chemical reactors [43], [46]. 3.3 Eulerian Model (Multifluid Model) Theory and Features: It is the most common multiphase flow analysis method that considers and models each phase as an independent continuum [43]. For each phase, the mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations are set up and solved separately, and the interphase interactions (drag, heat transfer, mass transfer, etc.) are modeled through the interphase exchange term to connect the equations [43]. Advantages: It can analyze various types of multiphase flows (gas-liquid, gas-solid, liquid-solid, liquid-liquid, etc.), and is particularly strong in dense dispersed flows or flows where complex interphase interactions are important [43]. It is advantageous in identifying the detailed flow characteristics of each phase. Disadvantages: Since separate equations are solved for each phase, the computational cost is the highest, and it may be difficult to secure convergence and stability [43]. The accuracy of the phase interaction model has a great influence on the overall analysis results. Applications: Widely applied to complex and phase-interaction dominated flows such as fluidized bed reactors, bubble columns, slurry transport, spray drying, nuclear non-safety analysis (core melt behavior), shock wave-bubble interaction, etc. [43], [45]. Approach / Model Basic principles Treatment of each phase Interaction modeling Applied flow characteristics Advantages Disadvantages Main application areas Eulerian-Eulerian Each phase is considered as a separate, interpenetrating continuum [1], [2], [43] Independent conservation equations are solved for each phase (field variables such as velocity, pressure, volume fraction, etc.) [1], [2], [43] Momentum, mass, and energy exchange terms between phases are considered [1], [2], [43] Dispersed phase is mixed with continuous phase, dispersed phase element size &lt; grid size [2], high-concentration dispersed phase flow [43] Efficient when dispersed phase concentration is high [1], various flow phenomena Capture[2], detailed flow characteristics of each phase are advantageous[43] Interaction model accuracy is important[1], local average accuracy is poor in dilute flows[1], computational cost is the highest[43] Bubbling flow, slurry flow, fluidized bed, particulate suspension flow, bubble column, etc.[1],[2],[43] Volume of Fluid (VOF) model Tracking clear interface between immiscible fluids[2],[43],[44] Tracking fluid volume fraction in each cell, defining cells including interface, sharing a single momentum equation[2],[43] Modeling interface-related physical forces such as surface tension[2] Existence of clear and large interface (free surface, laminar flow, etc.), boundary curvature radius &gt; grid size[2],[43] Relatively accurate capture of clear interface[2],[43], suitable for cases where interface is distinct[2], can be computationally cost-effective[43] Fine grid required for detailed boundary shape[2], suitable for interpenetrating/mixing flows Misfit[2],[44], large slip between phases causes errors (pressure drop, underestimation of liquid fraction)[1],[2], mass transfer between phases is not directly considered (default)[44] Free surface flow (waves, sloshing), laminar flow, large bubble flow, packing, inkjet[2],[43],[45] Eulerian model (Two-Fluid Model)(general name of Eulerian-Eulerian)(same as Eulerian-Eulerian approach described above)(same as Eulerian-Eulerian approach described above)(same as Eulerian-Eulerian approach described above)(same as Eulerian-Eulerian approach described above)(same as Eulerian-Eulerian approach described above)(same as Eulerian-Eulerian approach described above)Mixture model All phases are assumed to share common velocity and temperature fields (one mixed fluid)[5],[43],[46] Conservation equations are solved for the entire mixture, Slip velocity of each phase is approximated by an algebraic relationship [2], [43], [46] Considering drag between phases [2], modeling of phase change is possible [46] When the difference in relative velocity between phases is not large, uniform distribution of dispersed phase, assuming local equilibrium Effective flow [2], [43] Most efficient in computational cost [46], suitable for relatively evenly mixed flows Difficult to model detailed interface shapes/complex interactions [43], not suitable for flows with large phase separation Dispersed droplet/particle flow (spray, particle transport), gas-liquid mixed flow with slight slip [43], [46] Eulerian-Lagrangian Eulerian analysis for continuous phase (fluid), Lagrangian tracking for dispersed phase (particles, etc.) [1], [2] Continuous phase: Eulerian grid-based equation solution, dispersed phase: individual particle motion equation (F = ma) solution [1], [2] Between phases (continuous phase → Dispersed phase, dispersed phase → continuous phase) Momentum, mass, energy exchange[1],[2] Diluted flow with low dispersed phase concentration (less than 10%)[1],[2], individual particle behavior is important[1] Accurately track individual particle behavior/local influence (diluted flow)[1],[2], Easy to consider particle size distribution/characteristic changes[1] The more dispersed phase particles there are, the more computational cost increases[1], Modeling collisions/interactions between particles is complicated[1], Not suitable for dense flows[1], Extraction of particle statistics is cumbersome[1] Spray, particle/droplet scattering during combustion, particle scattering flow, etc.[1],[2] Discrete Phase Model (DPM)(Representative name for Eulerian-Lagrangian)(Same as the explanation of the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach above)(Same as the explanation of the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach above)(Same as the explanation of the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach above)(Same as the explanation of the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach above)(Same as the explanation of the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach above)(Same as the explanation of the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach above)(Same as the explanation of the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach above)( Eulerian-Lagrangian approach description) Spray combustion, fluidized bed reactors, gas-solid separation, pneumatic transport systems, etc. [2] Hybrid model: A hybrid approach that combines the advantages of VOF and Eulerian models is also used in research and practice. For example, a study by Dynaflow Research Group showed that a combination of VOF and Eulerian models can more accurately predict complex flows with distinct interfaces and dispersed phases, such as slug/Churn flows [20]. The selection of a model should be made by comprehensively considering the type of flow phenomenon to be analyzed, phase concentration, required accuracy, and computational resources [1], [2], [43]. 4. Chemical Reaction Model (Combustion, Species Transport) Modeling chemical reactions, especially combustion processes, using CFD is a complex problem that considers fluid flow, heat transfer, mixing of chemical species, and reaction rates simultaneously [1], [2]. To this end, the Species Transport Equation, which tracks the change in the distribution of each chemical species in the system, is solved, and a model is applied to calculate the chemical reaction rate [1], [2]. Model family / Model principle Features Applied flow characteristics Advantages and disadvantages Species Transport Model Solves the transport equation for each individual chemical species [2] Directly tracks the concentration of each chemical species [2], linked to the turbulent diffusion model [1] General reaction system Detailed prediction of the concentration of each chemical species possible [2] Very high computational cost when many chemical species/reactions are included [2] Turbulence-Chemical Reaction Interaction (TCI) Model Considers the interaction between turbulence and chemical reaction, determines the actual reaction rate [1], [2] Models the reaction rate by comparing the turbulent mixing time scale and the chemical reaction time scale [1], [2] Reaction in turbulent flow Considers the effect of turbulence on the reaction The assumptions of the model may differ from the actual phenomenon Eddy-Dissipation Model (EDM) / Eddy Break-Up (EBU) Model The chemical reaction rate is determined by the turbulent mixing rate. Assumptions[1],[2] Ignore chemical dynamics (assumed very fast)[2], Consider turbulent fine mixing[2] Turbulent diffusion flame (non-premixed, partially premixed)[1],[2] Stable flame, system with few reactions (2-3)[1],[2] Relatively simple to implement, good computational efficiency[1],[2] Inappropriate for premixed fuel[2], Reaction temperature/intermediate species composition prediction limited[1], Inaccurate when chemical dynamics is important for reaction rate[1],[2] Complex chemistry model Direct use of detailed chemical reaction mechanism (reaction equation, chemical species, rate constants, etc.)[2] Requires detailed chemical species, reaction, thermodynamic/transport characteristic information[2], Use of stiff ODE solver[2], Indirect consideration of turbulence effects (turbulent diffusion)[2] Complex phenomena such as flame stabilization/extinguishment/re-ignition[2] Detailed prediction of flame structure, intermediate species, contaminants, etc. possible[2] Very low computational cost Large (especially when reaction mechanism is large)[2], chemical kinetics data required[2]Laminar Flame Concept (LFC)Generate laminar flame table using detailed chemistry, use based on mixing fraction in turbulent field[1],[2]Use extinguished laminar flame state relationship[1], use mixing fraction and its distribution statistics[1]Turbulent flame (especially diffusion flame)[1],[2]Prediction of detailed chemical species/temperature is possible[1], excellent prediction of intermediate reactants such as CO[1]Chemical mechanism computational burden, spatial resolution required[1]Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC)Assume reaction occurs only in fine-scale region of turbulent eddies, detailed chemistry coupling[2]Use turbulent time scale to determine average reaction rate[2], detailed chemical reaction mechanism required[2]Turbulent flame, detailed chemistry is important[2]Consideration of the influence of detailed chemical reaction, handling of complex reaction system[2]Model assumptions may not be true under certain conditions, detailed chemical data required[2]Eddy-contact Micromixing ModelLiquid-liquid reactions, diffusion limited reactions modeling[2]Differences in turbulent mixing time scale calculation (similar procedure to EBU)[2]Liquid-liquid interface reactions, low molecular diffusivity liquid flows[2]Suitable for liquid reaction modeling[2](data lacking)Other related models:Spray models:Models the behavior of droplets, vaporization, mixing, etc. when liquid fuel is injected, and are coupled with turbulence models (Kelvin-Helmholtz/Rayleigh-Taylor, etc.) and chemical reaction models[2].G-equation models:Models that track premixed flame propagation, treating the flame front as an equivalent surface and modeling the velocity[2]. They are used especially for premixed combustion such as in automobile engines[2].The choice of a chemical reaction model should take into account fuel type, combustion morphology (premixed/non-premixed), required prediction detail (simple temperature vs. detailed chemical species), and computational resources.5. Heat Transfer Model (Conduction, Convection, Radiation) In CFD analysis, heat transfer is closely related to flow phenomena and is essential for predicting temperature distribution and heat flow [1], [2]. Heat is mainly transferred through three mechanisms: conduction, convection, and radiation[1]. Mechanism/Model Principle Governing Laws and Characteristics Applied Flow Characteristics Considerations Conduction Transfer of heat energy through direct contact within a medium[1] Fourier&#39;s Law: Q = -k * A * (dT/dx)[1] k: Thermal conductivity (material property)[1] Occurs in solids, liquids, and gases (effective in solids)[1] Energy transfer between molecules in solid regions and fluids[1] Defining thermal conductivity for each material is required[1], but contact conductivity can be considered[1] Convection Transfer of heat energy by the movement of a fluid[1] Newton&#39;s Law of Cooling: Q = h * A * ΔT[1] h: Convective heat transfer coefficient (depends on fluid properties, flow pattern, velocity, geometry, etc.)[1] Natural convection (difference in density) or forced convection (external force)[1] Heat accompanying fluid flow Transfer[1] Linked to the momentum/energy equation of the fluid[2], modeling turbulence near the wall and boundary layer resolution are important[2] RadiationTransfer of heat energy through electromagnetic waves (no medium required)[1] Stefan-Boltzmann Law: Q = ε * σ * A * (T₂⁴-T₁⁴)[1] ε: Emissivity[1] Occurs in all objects (important in high temperature environments)[1] Heat transfer through high temperature environments, vacuum, transparent/translucent media[2] Radiation between surfaces (calculating shape factor/view factor)[1], ambient radiation[1], cavity radiation[1], consideration of material spectral properties is important[2] Discrete Transfer Radiation Method (DTRM) Calculating radiant energy exchange by tracing radiation[1] Radiation is launched in a specific direction, considering absorption/emission at boundaries and media[1] Radiation transfer in flames/high temperature media[1] Setting the number and direction of radiation [1] Other radiation models (P1 model, Surface-to-Surface model, etc.) (Different according to the form of governing equation or calculation method) [12] (Different according to the application field) (Considering the characteristics of each model) Combined heat transfer and coupled analysis: In actual engineering problems, three heat transfer mechanisms occur in combination, and heat transfer between the fluid region and the solid region (Conjugate Heat Transfer, CHT) is considered important [1], [2]. For example, when analyzing the heat transfer of an engine piston, convection/radiation heat transfer of the combustion gas and conduction inside the piston occur together, and a co-simulation technique that links CFD (fluid) analysis and FEM (solid) thermal analysis is used to analyze the effect of a heat barrier coating (TBC) [2]. This technique repeatedly exchanges the heat transfer boundary conditions at the interface between the two analysis domains and finds a converged solution [2]. 6. Dynamic Mesh and Moving Boundary Problem Handling Techniques Dynamic mesh techniques are used to solve problems where the boundaries or internal structures of the analysis domain move or deform with time. This is seen in a variety of applications such as piston motion, valve opening and closing, rotating body flow, and free surface displacement [1], [2]. Dynamic meshing techniques must address the major challenges of preventing grid distortion, maintaining grid quality, and ensuring computational efficiency [1], [2]. Technique Principles Features and Methods Advantages Disadvantages and Limitations Application Cases Moving Mesh Real-time adjustment of node positions during analysis [2] Concentrating the mesh in areas requiring resolution [2] Interpolation-free (simultaneous mesh movement/analysis, no re-interpolation required) vs. Interpolation (interpolation after mesh movement) [2], [5] Easy to adjust grid resolution according to solution changes [2] Possibility of numerical errors in the interpolation method [2], [5], Increased need to solve Stiff ODE [2] Irregular/complex boundary deformation [2], [5], Adaptive resolution required Layering Adding/removing grid layers adjacent to a regularly moving wall [1], [3] Suitable for linear motion of walls [5] Efficient for linear motion, low computational cost [5], Most accurate/efficient for regular linear motion [5] Suitable for nonlinear/complex boundary deformation Limitations[5]Regular linear motion such as piston-cylinder motion[5]SmoothingRearrange all grid joints to alleviate grid distortion (insufficient data)Relieve grid distortion (insufficient data)(insufficient data)RemeshingPartially regenerate only severely distorted grid areas (local remeshing)[1](insufficient data)Resolve severe grid distortion, maintain grid quality[1]Concern about increased numerical error/cost during repeated remeshing/interpolation[1], required for complex nonlinear deformation[5]Complex nonlinear deformation, multiple moving objects[5]Sliding / Overlapping MeshSeparate management of translational/rotational angle subdomains of block units, data exchange on interfaceEfficient for simple block movement/rotationComplexity of processing interfaces between blocksRotary body flow (rotor-stator), simple translational motionOthers (Hybrid)Combination of several techniques above[1],[5](insufficient data)Flexibility in solving complex problems[5]Increased implementation complexity[1],[5]Complex nonlinear deformation, multiple movements Wall/Multiple Objects[5]Key Issues and Practical Considerations:Mesh Quality Control:Severe mesh distortion during an analysis can cause the analysis to be halted if it results in negative cell volumes[1]. Mesh quality metrics should be used to monitor the condition and take appropriate action when critical thresholds are reached.Numerical Conservation:Moving meshes require specialized numerical techniques to ensure conservation of physical quantities such as mass and momentum[2],[5].Parameter Sensitivity:The performance of a particular technique (e.g., mesh reshaping time scale) is sensitive to parameter settings, which are often determined empirically[2].Coupling with Multiphase Flow:In multiphase flow analyses such as free surface tracking (VOF, Level-set), dynamic meshing can play a significant role in improving the interfacial resolution. Dynamic meshing and moving boundary analysis are essential techniques for applying CFD to complex real-world problems, but it is important to find a balance between mesh quality, computational efficiency, and numerical stability[1],[2],[3],[5].7. Verification &amp; Validation (V&amp;V) Essential Element of CFD Theory: V&amp;V. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation is a powerful tool for numerically predicting real physical phenomena, but the reliability of the results must be secured through verification and validation processes [50], [51]. V&amp;V is a major means of evaluating the accuracy and reliability of CFD analysis, and is an essential foundation for utilizing CFD results in decision-making in engineering and science [50], [55], [56]. The CFD analysis process generally consists of preprocessing, solving, postprocessing, and verification and validation (V&amp;V) stages that evaluate the reliability of the results. This paper details the academic content of the V&amp;V phase, focusing on how to ensure confidence in CFD results. Definition of basic V&amp;V terms and concepts Key terms used in the V&amp;V field should be clearly distinguished [50], [51]. Verification: The process of checking that the numerical model and code accurately represent the developer&#39;s conceptual model (mathematical equations) and solutions [50], [51], [56]. It is essentially &quot;solving the equations right&quot; [56] and is primarily a mathematical and computer science problem [55]. It assesses the correctness of the code implementation (freeness of bugs) and the numerical correctness (convergence, error) of the proposed calculations [51]. Validation: The process of assessing the extent to which the CFD model matches the real physical system or phenomenon from the perspective of its intended use [50], [51], [55]. It is essentially &quot;solving the right equations&quot; and is primarily a physical problem [55]. The physical accuracy of the model is assessed by comparison with experimental data or reliable measurement data [50]. Error: A &#39;known defect&#39;, which refers to a difference in cause that can be identified and quantified, such as discretization error, lack of iterative convergence, or programming error [51], [56]. Uncertainty: A potential defect due to &#39;incomplete information or lack of knowledge&#39; [51], [56]. It refers to the unknown variability or measurement error inherent in boundary conditions, material properties, experimental measurements, etc. [50]. Verification Verification is the process of verifying the correctness of the code itself and the numerical accuracy of specific calculations [50], [51]. 1. Code Verification Code verification is the process of verifying that the CFD software (solver) accurately solves the implemented mathematical model (differential equation, etc.) [50], [51]. It is mainly done during the software development phase, but it is also important when adding new features or updating versions. Goal: Identify and remove programming errors (bugs) and mathematical model implementation errors in the code [51]. Method: Comparison with Analytical Solutions: Check if the CFD results agree with the analytically known solution under simple geometries and conditions [50], [51]. Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS): After assuming an arbitrary solution to a complex set of equations, source terms satisfying that solution are added to the equations, and then the accuracy of the CFD code when solving the equations containing these source terms is evaluated [51], [54]. It is powerful in checking numerical algorithms and programming errors in the code itself [54]. Software Quality Engineering (SQE): Apply software engineering techniques such as static/dynamic analysis, unit testing, regression testing, and coverage testing to ensure the robustness and correctness of the code [50]. Consistency Check: Check that the computational results satisfy the fundamental physical laws (e.g., conservation of mass, momentum, and energy) [51]. Comparison with other codes: Comparing the results for the same problem with other verified CFD codes (especially those using different numerical methods) can also be a method of code verification [51]. 2. Calculation Verification / Solution VerificationCalculation verification is the process of evaluating and quantifying the numerical errors (mainly discretization errors) inherent in individual CFD simulation results performed for a specific problem [50], [51]. Goal: Determine the accuracy of a specific computational solution and estimate the error bounds contained in the results [51]. Sources of errors: Insufficient spatial (mesh) discretization, insufficient time discretization, insufficient convergence of iterations, computer floating-point errors, etc. [50], [51]. Method: Convergence Study: Compare simulation results while systematically changing spatial resolution (mesh size) or time resolution (time step) to evaluate the tendency of the solution to converge and the rate of error reduction [51], [53]. It is common to compute at least three different resolutions (fine, medium, and coarse grid/time step) [51], [55]. Richardson Extrapolation: uses results obtained at the same series of resolutions to estimate the value when the resolution becomes infinitely small (ideal solution) and quantifies the error and order of convergence of the computational result [51], [53], [55], [56]. Grid Convergence Index (GCI): A quantitative index representing the uncertainty of the computational result according to the grid (or time) refinement based on Richardson Extrapolation [51], [53], [55], [56]. It is widely used as a standard for reporting the results of computational verification [55]. A priori vs. A posteriori Error estimation: A priori: Error estimation based on the theoretical characteristics (e.g., convergence order) of the numerical method used [53]. A posteriori: Errors are empirically estimated based on actual computational results (e.g., differences in parameters between adjacent cells) [53]. This includes grid independence verification, RMS error estimation, etc. [53]. Iterative convergence check: For steady analysis, it is checked whether the convergence indicators, such as residuals, have sufficiently decreased below the established convergence criterion (e.g., 10⁻⁶ or 10⁻⁸) during the computational process to ensure that the solution has reached a stable state [50], [51]. For unsteady analysis, it is checked whether the convergence criterion is satisfied at each time step. Validation Validation is the process of evaluating how accurately the validated CFD model simulates the actual physical phenomenon [50], [55], [56]. It is essential to establish the physical reliability of the CFD results. 1. Definition and Comparison to Experimental DataGoal: Determine whether the CFD model (governing equations, physical model, boundary conditions, etc.) predicts the real physical system with the intended accuracy [50], [55].Method: Compare CFD simulation results to actual experimental data, field measurements, or highly reliable benchmark data [50], [55], [56]. Quantitative comparisons that go beyond simple visual agreement are essential [50], [55].2. Guidelines for Designing Validation ExperimentsExperiments designed for the purpose of model validation differ from traditional phenomenological studies [50], [55]. Validation experiments should be designed from the perspective of considering the CFD code as a &#39;client&#39;, and close collaboration between CFD developers, experimentalists, and data analysts is essential [50], [55]. Key requirements: Detailed and accurate measurement and reporting of experimental conditions (inputs, boundary conditions) and material properties [50], [55]. Quantification of errors and uncertainties inherent in experimental measurements [50], [55], [56]. Identification of statistical characteristics of data through replicated experiments [55]. Design of a validation hierarchy appropriate to the validation purpose [50], [55]. 3. Validation Metrics and Quantitative Comparison Metrics are needed to quantitatively express the goodness of agreement between CFD results and experimental data [50], [55]. Quantitative metrics: Mean error, root mean square (RMSE) [53]. Agreement within experimental data uncertainty range [55]. Advanced statistical methods including uncertainty quantification (UQ) [51], [55]. Uncertainty-inclusive comparison: The validation process should consider both the computational error and modeling uncertainty of the CFD results and the measurement uncertainty of the experimental data to compare them [50], [55], [56]. ASME VV20 and ITTC guidelines provide procedures to integrate these uncertainties [55]. 4. Validation Hierarchy Direct validation of a complex system as a whole can be difficult and expensive [50], [55]. Therefore, a building-block approach is recommended, which decomposes the system into progressively simpler steps and performs validation [50], [55], [56]. Step: Unit problem → Benchmark case → Subsystem → Complete system [50]. Purpose: Systematically build confidence in the overall system model by intensively testing the prediction accuracy of specific physical phenomena or specific components at each step [50]. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) Uncertainty quantification is a very important element in V&amp;V, especially in the validation process [50], [55], [56]. When comparing CFD results with experimental data, the inherent uncertainties on both sides must be clearly understood and quantified for an accurate assessment [50], [55]. Types of uncertainty: Aleatory (intrinsic/irreversible): Random variability inherent in the physical system itself (e.g., instantaneous fluctuations in turbulent flow) [50]. Epistemic (lack of knowledge/reversible): Uncertainty caused by lack of knowledge about the system, model, input variables, etc. (e.g., inaccurate boundary conditions, incomplete material property data) [50]. Sources of uncertainty: Experimental measurement uncertainty, input parameter uncertainty, physical model uncertainty, computational error (quantified during validation) [50], [51], [55]. UQ methodology: Nondeterministic simulation to deal with input uncertainty [50]. Probabilistic sampling techniques (Monte Carlo, Latin Hypercube) [50]. Sensitivity analysis [51]. Statistical methods such as Bayesian inference Methods [51], [55]. Role of UQ in V&amp;V: Establish confidence intervals for CFD predictions based on uncertainty information, and evaluate the validity of the model by considering these uncertainty intervals when comparing with experimental data [50], [55].",

Conventional RANS assumes steady-state and solves the time-averaged equations to obtain the final mean flow field.[6]URANS computes snapshots of the time-varying mean flow at each time step.[6]Captures Physics:URANS is better at capturing large-scale turbulent structures and unsteady phenomena (e.g., eddy shedding, periodic separation) that evolve over time than RANS.[6]However, as with RANS, small-scale turbulent fluctuations are still modeled by the turbulence model.[2]Time Evolution MethodURANS simulations start with an initial flow field and update the flow variables iteratively over time steps. At each time step, the average momentum equation and the turbulence model equations are solved to compute the average velocity, pressure, turbulence variables, etc. at the next time step.[6] The time step size (Δt) and the choice of numerical technique (Explicit/Implicit) affect the stability and accuracy of the simulation. The mathematical model The Reynolds-Averaged Momentum Equation has the following form:[2]∂ūᵢ/∂t + ūⱼ∂ūᵢ/∂xⱼ = -(1/ρ)∂p̄/∂xᵢ + ν(∂²ūᵢ/∂xⱼ²) - ∂(ū&#39;ᵢū&#39;ⱼ)/∂xⱼ, where ūᵢ is the average velocity component, p̄ is the average pressure, ν is the kinematic viscosity, and ρ is the density. The last term ū&#39;ᵢū&#39;ⱼ is the Reynolds stress tensor, which is modeled by the turbulence model. For example, the k-ω SST model solves the transport equations for the turbulent kinetic energy k and a specific dissipation rate ω to model the Reynolds stresses.[5]Advantages and DisadvantagesAdvantagesDisadvantages- Computational cost-effective: significantly lower computational cost than LES or DNS[7]- Limitations on reproducing turbulent microstructure: loss of detailed structure since all turbulent scales are modeled[6]- Widely used in industrial fields, high reliability: long-term validation and many application examples[2,7]- Modeling errors are possible: inaccuracies due to assumptions in the turbulent model, especially in complex flows (separation, strong pressure gradients)[2]- Suitable for solving large/long-time scale problems: practical for practical engineering problems[2]- Setting appropriate turbulence models and inlet boundary conditions is important[6]- Capable of capturing some unsteady phenomena (compared to RANS)[7]- Limitations on the physical interpretation of the time-averaged concept[6]Major applications and industrial/academic examplesAerospace and automotive aerodynamics: unsteady vortex shedding, flow around vehicles[8]Turbomachinery: compressors, turbine blade flow, pump interiors Flow[6,8] Flow around structures: Wind load around buildings, flow around bridges[6] Marine engineering: Flow around ships and offshore structures[6] Flow inside engines: Capturing some of the unsteady flow during intake/exhaust and combustion processes in the combustion chamber[8] Latest research trends (last 3-5 years) Recent URANS model research has been conducted in the following directions: Refinement and improvement of turbulence models: Modifications (e.g., helicity correction, QCR model) and development of new models are being conducted to improve the accuracy of existing k-ε, k-ω SST models.[5] Research on hybrid RANS-LES techniques: Hybrid models such as DDES (Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation) and IDDES (Improved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation) that combine the efficiency of URANS and the accuracy of LES are actively studied, with a particular focus on modeling wall flow and separation phenomena.[2,9] Utilization of machine learning/AI: Utilizing experimental data or high-precision simulation data (LES/DNS) to improve the empirical coefficients of turbulence models. Research is being attempted to develop a compensation or data-based model.[2] Expanding applicability to complex flows: Research is ongoing to verify and improve the prediction accuracy of URANS/hybrid models in complex geometries (turbomachinery interior, leakage flow, etc.) in actual industrial settings.[2,8]References[2] Lattice Boltzmann Methods for Industrial Applications - ResearchGate.[5] Assessment of advanced RANS turbulence models for prediction of complex flows in compressors - Sciencedirect.[6] RANS and URANS. - CFD Online Forums.[7] Comparative Analysis for RANS, URANS, and DDES Turbulence Models - Dlubal Software FAQ.[8] Incompressible LBM (Lattice Boltzmann Method) Advanced Options - SimScale Docs.

It is common to compute at least three different resolutions (fine, medium, and coarse grid/time step) [2, 6]. Richardson Extrapolation: Uses results obtained at the same series of resolutions to estimate the value when the resolution becomes infinitely small (ideal solution) and quantifies the error and order of convergence of the computational results [2, 4, 6, 7]. Grid Convergence Index (GCI): A quantitative index representing the uncertainty of the computational results according to grid (or time) refinement based on Richardson Extrapolation [2, 4, 6, 7]. Widely used as a standard for reporting computational verification results [6]. A priori vs. A posteriori error estimation: A priori: Error estimation based on the theoretical characteristics (convergence order, etc.) of the numerical method used [4].

Built-in geometry creation tools: The M-STAR Pre GUI includes basic geometry creation functions (e.g. cylinders, boxes, etc.) as well as a catalog of parametric geometries (e.g. standard stirred tanks, impellers, baffles, piping, etc.), allowing the user to dynamically create and assemble geometries. Immersed Boundary Method (IBM): Effectively embeds complex or moving solid boundaries within the mesh. This allows simulations to be performed on a simple Cartesian grid without the need to create a volumetric mesh that exactly matches the boundary. M-STAR Pre GUI: Preprocessing is primarily done via the M-STAR Pre graphical user interface. Users construct a model tree to set up the simulation domain, fluid definition, solid geometry (by loading or generating STL files), boundary conditions, physics models, solver parameters, etc. step by step. Set grid resolution: There is no volumetric mesh generation, but the user defines the grid resolution for the entire computational domain. This directly affects the simulation accuracy and computation time. The ability to locally increase the grid resolution (Local Refinement Zones) can also be supported. Define User-Defined Functions (UDFs) and Properties: Through the Python API, one can implement user-defined boundary conditions, physics models, initial conditions, etc., or define various fluid properties (viscosity, density, etc., including Newtonian/non-Newtonian fluids).",

Causes: Incompatible or outdated GPU drivers, lack of OpenGL support, 3D acceleration issues in remote desktop environments, etc. Check and fix: Make sure the latest NVIDIA drivers are installed. Make sure your GPU supports OpenGL 3.2+ (Windows) or 3.3+ (Linux). For Windows, make sure your GPU is running in WDDM mode. When using remote desktops (RDP, etc.), check whether 3D acceleration (hardware rendering) is supported and set up (a specialized remote visualization tool such as NICE DCV is recommended). Generate debug log files (e.g., using the MStarPost -l, paraview -l commands) to check for error messages. Divergence or Instability in simulation: Symptom: Abnormal values (NaN, Infinity) occur during solver execution, physically implausible results, sudden calculations. Abort. Causes: Inadequate mesh resolution (too coarse or insufficient in certain regions), too large a time step, incorrect boundary condition settings, incorrect physics model parameters, numerical instability. Solution: Try increasing the lattice resolution (note increased computation time). Try decreasing the time step (check the Courant number). Review the boundary condition settings (type, values). Verify that the parameters of the physics model (e.g. turbulence model, bubble/particle model) are appropriate. Verify that the initial conditions are physically reasonable. Check the log file for specific warning or error messages. Gridding related issues: M-STAR CFD uses IBM, so there are fewer volumetric meshing issues in the traditional sense, but STL file quality, feature location, and mesh resolution settings are important. Symptoms: Geometry is not recognized properly, flow passes through geometry, etc. Solution: Fix errors in the STL file (holes, overlapping surfaces, etc.). Check the size and position of the geometry, and adjust the grid resolution so that it can sufficiently represent the detailed features of the geometry. License error: Symptom: Messages such as software execution failure and license server connection failure. Resolution: Check whether the license server address and port information are correct, whether the license server is operating normally, and whether the license period is valid. Also check network issues such as firewall settings. Python API linkage issue: Symptom: Python script execution error, module import failure, etc. Resolution: Check Python version compatibility, check whether the required environment variables (PYTHONPATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc.) are set, and check whether the M-STAR CFD Python library is installed correctly. Cloud/container environment specific issues: Symptom: GPU recognition problems in environments such as AWS, Docker, etc., MPI communication errors, NVRTC compilation errors, GPU peer-to-peer access problems, etc. Resolution: Follow the M-STAR CFD installation guide and recommended settings for the environment. Check the container image, virtual machine settings, network configuration, etc.",
